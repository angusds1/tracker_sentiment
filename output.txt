Instructions]
I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, François Bordonado. Please go ahead.
François-José Bordonado
Vice-President of Investor Relations
Thank you, Shane. I'm François Bordonado, Dassault Systèmes Investor Relations. From the company, we have Bernard
Charles, our Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer; and Pascal Daloz, Chief Operations Officer and Chief Financial
Officer. We hope you and your families are doing well, and I would like to welcome you to Dassault Systèmes First
Quarter 2021 Webcast Presentation.
At the end of the presentation, we'll take questions from participants. Later today, we will also hold a conference call.
Dassault Systèmes results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. Most of the financial figures on this conference call
are presented on a non-IFRS basis, with revenue growth rate in constant currencies unless otherwise noted. For an
understanding of the differences between the IFRS and non-IFRS, please see the reconciliation table included in our
press release.
Some of the comments we'll make during today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements, which could differ
materially from actual results. Please refer to our risk factors in our 2020 Document d'enregistrement universel. I will now
hand over to Bernard Charles.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Thank you very much, François. Hello to everyone. I think Pascal and I have quite interesting facts to share with you that
-- facts that will echo very well what we announced and shared with you on February 6, 2020, which I call the new horizon
for Dassault Systèmes.
But first, when it comes to Q1, the first quarter of 2021, software revenue was up 10%, excluding exchange rate, with 91%
of this revenue being software -- of the total revenue being software. The license revenue is up 25%. And the EPS is also
quite strong, up 20% to be noticed, 28% if you exclude the exchange rate.
The second remark, I think, is really the fact that we continue to play the role of being a serious catalyst for the
transformation of life science at large, but also customer and consumer experiences as well as reimagine the retail with
Centric PLM on more, basically, we've got it on the announcement that we do today.
Of course, our [indiscernible] equity to be focused on citizen, customer and patient is not -- we don't take it lightly.
Harmonize product, nature and life need to be translated in the way we deliver solutions. So we focus on 3 sectors of the
economy: manufacturing industry, life science and health care and infrastructure and cities. And I think we have proof
points that we are progressing in those areas. We really took serious commitment to continue to reduce our footprint and
communicate our handprint, which is basically the effect of the use of our software, and I will refer to by the industries, and
I will refer to the excellent study done with Accenture and Dassault Systèmes about the deliver of virtual twin experience,
virtual twin. And we are finally upgrading our EPS guidance for 2021. Pascal will give you more detail -- interesting detail
about that.
So back to the [indiscernible] and the focus of what we do and the way we engineer our solutions for the market. I think
we are focusing on people at work, how they can become champion, learn and do better. Of course, the [ cooperation ]
with health on new therapeutics, on new even medical practices, and of course, the conditions of our living environment
with more sustainable environment. This is what you have illustrated here. This is the new profile of Dassault Systèmes on
how we conduct the arbitration of what we do.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL  APR 28, 2021
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 5So basically, if I summarize it, it's human-centric innovation, working with our customers and partners. And we see very
practical consequences of that, whether it's about food, on health, wellness, new treatment or prevent treatment. It's about
also inclusiveness, and it's about many, many aspects, whether I am a patient with the patient journey or whether I'm
using products that are not very useful and I want to have a better experience with those products.
So why reformulating as we did a year ago with Pascal with very precise publication, reformulating our role in the world
of manufactured goods, in the world of life science and health care as well as infrastructure, I think, is a good way to
understand our ambition on horizon for the future of Dassault Systèmes, and we want to translate it to facts quarter-after-
quarter to illustrate how it can generate a sustainable double-digit [indiscernible] growth.
Our reach today, if I do a quick zoom in on life science, we believe we are #1 in market share in life science. We have
over 8,000-plus active customers, the top 20 biopharma and med tech, all top 10 CROs. We have active partnership with
FDA and IMI. And we have, of course, a strong position both in drug development and medical devices. So it's really
science based. It's more than tracking citizen, it's a science-based platform.
We have over 50% of the world clinical trial are now supported by Dassault Systèmes Medidata platform with above
22,000 clinical trials with billions of data points. So we do big data. We don't comment it too often, but we do big data.
We do big data in manufacturing, too, a wide access to patient and to physicians. Here, you see 6.5 million for patient
and 45,000 physicians. A lot of access to hospital facilities, 22,000 on direct hospital connection, as you can see
here, including the incredible asset of imagery for 450 million images to really continue to develop AI-based predictive
understanding of what is happening.
So numbers, but it's to tell you, it's not a light position, and we want to continue to develop it in a very sustainable and
fair way for all the players. We are very pleased and I'm proud to see BioNTech, a European company, with all the
scientists, scientists and research and the passion for science. We feel close to them. So we are very pleased to expand
our partnership with them, with One Lab, BIOVIA, 3DEXPERIENCE, One Lab.
And what they do with it is really variant analysis on preclinical anticipation. Of course, increase the -- find the solutions,
increase the speed, improve the collaboration, standardize across labs and, of course, increase the quality of compliance
and efficiency and master the full end-to-end from R&D clinical on production manufacturing integration. So it's a beautiful
story as the one we have with Moderna, but we want to continue those kind of stories. We think that this is Dassault
Systèmes.
Karyopharm, another example, using clinical Medidata platform on the cloud. Really, they have moved from doing one
study in 2014 to now 15-plus study in 2021 with consistent solution on infrastructure for it. So the revenue is important,
the performance of company is important, but what it means for the impact on the society with those kind of partnership is
also a good reason why people are joining us in the world to be part of the Dassault Systèmes story.
Now on more traditional sectors, we are pleased to continue to expand with JLR, not the biggest producer in the world, but
really, they are quite innovative, and they have to be innovative. And I think that Thierry Bolloré's plan, reimagine, refocus
and create well-positioned, high-value solution is really something that will happen with this 3DEXPERIENCE platform.
What is noticeable here, you are quite familiar with what we do in manufacturing, but it's more than half of the use of
3DEXPERIENCE platform is based on data analytics and data science. This is noticeable. It's not only modeling and
simulation. It's data analytics on data science, cost, weight, energy performance. And we're going to do more together.
And of course, this is to support their commitment to electrification and also clean hydrogen fuel cell power development
where there is a lot of safety issues and infrastructure issues to be resolved.
Last not least, in a totally different sector where the consumer is the decision-maker, Gautier, they are doing home
releases for home retailers. And they are really using now the adoption of 3D to really create new shopping experience,
new consumer experiences. It's quite interesting to see, and I believe that it's the right timing because the new devices
that we all are going to have in our hands are going to be fully 3D enabled. And this will change retail, both for Centric
PLM, for HomeByMe and for many other activities related to apparel, retail at large, food and beverage, where you want to
see something as close as possible to the real world.
Finally, and I know many of you have been observing and maybe with a little smile about our -- my conviction 2 years ago
in 1999 when I said we will change the game in construction. The Bouygues announcement is not a minor one. I believe
that is as profound as moving the construction site, consuming only drawings to a construction site, consuming virtual
reality for all people, the virtual twin for all people who are involved in the construction site. So we are not starting from theDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL  APR 28, 2021
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 6engineering of the building but from actually the construction of infrastructures. And you know the target number of users
is not marginal. Bouygues plan to have in less than 3 years over 15,000 users using the 3DEXPERIENCE platform.
Cloud, mobile only with zero development of cloud but parameterization on smart, what we call intelligent experience. So
the current solutions don't offer that at this point of time. The current competitor don't have the web-based, cloud-centric
that can work on a phone, you do airplay on a big TV, so it's cost efficient. A phone can do airplay on a big TV, and you
can see the virtual twin of the construction. So Philippe Bonnave, the CEO of Bouygues Construction, is really, really
supporting this. I believe that this is the 3DEXPERIENCE platform in action.
Now there is a certain underestimation of what -- why the -- what is the 3DEXPERIENCE platform. To make it simple,
it connects people, ideas, data and help the world, the virtual world to be as close as possible to the real world. At the
middle of it is the experience, show me how it works. So we basically are concentrating on modeling and simulation, on
data science, science for modeling, science for simulation and science for data. That's the unique aspect of our platform.
And I think the JLR extensive use of data science in everything they do is a good illustration of that.
Side remark on the event in the first quarter. We did a very large virtual event for -- 3DEXPERIENCE Works for the
SOLIDWORKS lovers was very successful, 20,000 attendees. And you see here the expansion of this. We will continue to
invent new virtual events that are quite exciting perspective. The lesson learned from pandemic, I think, is quite interesting
from that standpoint.
And finally, on the important topics for us. We continue to be -- increase the clarity of our engagement on the footprint
and handprint. On the footprint, we signed the UN Global Compact as a partner, world's largest corporate sustainability
initiative, on the science-based measure of how you reduce footprint.
On the handprint, I have mentioned the study that we have been doing with Accenture, which is a very, very interesting
study and we are really very serious about leveraging the power of virtual twin experience for all industries. And we are
also a founding member of the EU Green Digital Coalition, and we are very proud to be part of this group, and we will be
an active player to share ideas. And there are more than 5,000 stakeholders engaged already. So this is to translate also
intent that, usually, you see in annual reports to reality the way we execute.
And a few showcases more, the expansion of our simulation environment for EV on hybrid with BMW. I think it's a great
showcase, and I think it's going to provide extraordinary references to many other players in the industry. As you know,
we already mentioned that the giant Toyota is adopting Power'By platform. This was announced last year, and they
continue to expand.
So in short, before I give the floor to Pascal, I believe we are walking the talk. Harmonizing product, nature and life is
an industry renaissance for both manufacturing, life science and health care as well as infrastructure. And we hope to
continue to report every quarter stories that proves it. Back to you, Pascal.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Thank you, Bernard. Thank you all of us joining us today. I hope everything is going well on your side. So let's start with
the performance, the financial performance review.
Total revenue increased 8%, at the high end of our 6% to 8% range, at EUR 1.174 billion. Software revenue growth of
10% came in above of our range of 7% to 9%. From a profitability standpoint, lower-than-planned expenses combined
with the high end of the guidance for revenue led to a significant outperformance at the operating margin and EPS level.
Now let's zoom on the component of the revenue. License and other software increased 25% versus our guide of 0 to
5%. About 5 points of this growth came from a CapEx preference from our customers. And the other contributions to
the upside came from strong results in China, SOLIDWORKS and also large 3DEXPERIENCE platform transactions,
especially in Transportation & Mobility. Subscription and support revenue increased 7% versus our guidance of 8%
to 10%. And during the quarter, about 1 point of the estimated recurring revenue growth outlook moved to a CapEx
purchase. However, the subscription revenue increased double digits, and the churn is really consistent with what we
have seen last year. So there is no concern at all on this front.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL  APR 28, 2021
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7With respect to services, we were able to improve our gross margin to 12.1% from 2.9% last year, thanks to the work
completed last year despite the revenue decrease of 9% compared to our range of minus 2% to plus 2%, and it's mainly
due to the extended lockdowns we have seen.
Now let's zoom and let's move to the regional software review. In Asia, software revenue increased 10% in Q1. China
was by far the best performing geo, up sharply, reflecting the strong growth across all the engagement models. It had the
highest growth both on software licenses as well for the recurring software revenue. Korea, we saw the beginning of the
recovery. And both in Korea and China, we also had key wins for 3DEXPERIENCE platform. In Japan, we saw a strong
performance in our indirect engagement model. And the vast majority of our 3DEXPERIENCE engagements such as
Toyota are proceeding as planned.
Just a side note, Bernard was mentioning Toyota. At Toyota, we have equipped almost 20,000 people, and 18 car
programs are ready on 3DEXPERIENCE platform right now. In India, despite the difficult environment, and we have
a lot of respect for what is going on right now for our partners, for our customers and also for our colleagues, so -- but
nevertheless, as the situation is slightly improving, we saw some year-over-year improvement.
In Europe, we are still seeing a mixed environment with software revenue up 6% in total. And Europe is almost split in 2
different parts, where it's -- we have the deconfinement, we are seeing the growth; and where we still have confinement,
the growth is a little bit more modest. So to be precise, the north and the south of Europe, we have the best performing
geo and improved activity in Transportation & Mobility, both with large mobility players as well as the automotive
suppliers. And we still have a modest growth in France and Germany despite the recovery we were speaking about in
Transportation & Mobility.
In the Americas, software revenue increased 14% with a strong growth in Life Sciences, thanks to Medidata, but also
in Transportation & Mobility. And this is an interesting case because it's a mix between the incumbent and also the
newcomers and new players, the EV guys. So clearly, we start to see a balanced growth between those 2 subsegments in
the auto sectors.
Now let's move to the split of the revenue by product line. Few things I want to say before to give some details. First of all,
we continue to increase the reach and the balance. During the first quarter, the Mainstream Innovation represent 23% of
the Software revenue. Life Sciences was 20%. And within Industrial Innovations, CATIA accounts for about 1/4 of our total
software, with complementary brands adding to 32%. So clearly, if you look at -- if you step back a little bit and you look at
what we did in the past, we have -- the revenue is relatively well balanced across the different product lines right now.
So let's zoom on Industrial Innovation. Industrial Innovation, we saw a strong momentum in these brands, notably
SIMULIA, ENOVIA, DELMIA and NETVIBES in Data Intelligence, Bernard, if you heard about it. While CATIA
3DEXPERIENCE software increased 12% overall, the activity led to a decrease to 1% for CATIA. In total, software
revenue increased 4% in Industrial Innovations.
Our Life Sciences software revenue increased 16%. We are seeing a strong momentum led by Medidata where software
revenue increased 20% in Q1 driven by the 3 big product lines. So Rave in clinical data management; Patient Cloud for
all the solutions to connect patients from home; and Acorn AI, the solution related to the artificial intelligence and data
analytics. Medidata also a solid operating margin performance and a strong cash flow from operations this quarter.
Mainstream Innovations. So software revenue increased 20% in Q1 and a strong growth for SOLIDWORKS and Centric
PLM. So SOLIDWORKS software revenue grew 18% in Q1 on both licenses software and recurring revenue strength.
And the software was up double digit in all the 3 regions of the world. To be noticed also, our partners are also seeing
good traction in 3DEXPERIENCE WORKS portfolio with a role leveraging our strength in collaboration and simulations,
especially.
Now let's move to the key trend in the industry. While we have covered a number of already industry indirectly, let me
share some Q1 performance highlights to give you a sense of activity by industry as we start the year. So beginning with
manufacturing industry, we had a double-digit growth software revenue in Transportation & Mobility, Marine & Offshore
and Home & Lifestyle.
Looking at Transportation & Mobility, this growth came from the strength across a number of domains, including
simulations, data analytics with NETVIBES. We are also starting to see a recovery with automotive suppliers and some
acceleration of investment by OEMs as they advance their new mobility initiatives. Speaking about Centric PLM. We
drove the double-digit growth also in Home & Lifestyle.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL  APR 28, 2021
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8In the Life Science and Health Care sectors, Life Science software revenue grew 16%, benefiting from growth in Life
Science product line as well as from an increased customer activity for SOLIDWORKS in the medical devices company
as well as SIMULIA. We are also seeing an increased customer sales engagement in manufacturing with life sciences
company. We spoke about it, but we see more and more of these trends materializing in the revenue.
In the Infrastructure & City sectors, construction increased double digits, led by our activity, especially in China this past
quarter.
Now I want to come back to our growth strategy and to -- because you remember, at the Capital Markets Day in Q4 last
year, we discussed the growth axis. And regarding the 3DEXPERIENCE platform adoptions, there are 2 axes. The first
one, we call it Value Up, which is increasing the value we bring to the large installed base we have through a broader
adoption of all the domain expertise we have. Two, Value Wide is nothing more than to extend 3DEXPERIENCE to new
customers, including the mainstream market adoptions. So Value Up and Value Wide will bring 3DEXPERIENCE to
represent about 2/3 of our software revenue by 2025.
Now for the quarter, as you can see, 3DEXPERIENCE software revenue increased 18%, with license and other software
revenue up sharply, 57%, which is almost twice the growth of the license and other software revenue in general. The
largest license deal in Q1 were more evenly weighted towards Asia and especially China.
The second topic I want to just come back is the cloud adoptions. I know it's one of your favorite topic. We see this as
an opportunity to bring to us new category of users and new usages. So looking at the cloud contribution, it represents
about 18.5% of our total software revenue in Q1, which is 2 points increase compared to 1 year ago. Based upon our end
market sectors, we set the goal last year to reach EUR 2 billion in cloud software revenue by 2025, which would represent
an estimated 1/3 of our total software revenue compared to 17% in 2020.
Just a quick reminder, our cloud strategy is set to meet our clients wherever they are in the context of their industries. And
that's very important to take this into consideration because we started the digitalization in the industry 20, 25 years ago,
so clearly, we have this legacy to take care. And the starting point is not the same for all the customers we serve. That's
the reason why our strategy is not one-fits-all, but we have different paths for the cloud.
First one is the native on the cloud. And usually, this is the path used by the newcomers of the new industry we are
entering in. The extended with both on-premise and on-the-cloud solutions, which is usually a way to connect with, for
example, simulations capacity when you need a lot of computing power and maybe you do not have it on your premise
and you can leverage the cloud capability to make this happening. And also the connected with on-premise software
solutions connected to the 3DEXPERIENCE platform on the cloud for collaboration purpose, which is our Power'By
strategy.
In terms of capabilities, we released 21x. 95% of our portfolio on-premise capabilities are available as cloud solutions. And
with the new release coming this year, we will have more application roles being available on the cloud that we have on-
premise.
Now to illustrate this growth strategy, let me zoom on some customer case just to illustrate that we walk the talk. The first
one is I wanted to share one of our SOLIDWORKS customers, Teel Plastics. They have adopted the DELMIAWORKS.
In this example, Teel Plastics is a company developing plastic tubing for many medical applications. And they are able to
quickly scale and manage multiple production sites at the same time, especially important as part of the COVID-19 swab
testing products. So that's a good example how we can expand the scope of what we do, leveraging the large installed
base we have. And again, these trends coming from the WORKS family is very visible on many fronts.
In terms of Value Wide, let's say a few words about Centric PLM. Centric PLM software and services revenue were up
sharply in Q1. Sustaining recovery began in Q4 last year with record booking but also a strong new customer acquisition,
which has been multiplied almost by 3. It shows also improvement in key geographic markets, including Asia, especially
a strong expansion in China is happening right now. And finally, in addition to its leading market position in home and
lifestyle with a global brand in fashion, we are more and more diversifying Centric PLM in retail and food and beverage.
That's something very key. We will complete the acquisitions at the end of Q2.
Another example to the cloud is BIOVIA. As you may know, BIOVIA, we are shifting progressively to subscriptions
and also to the cloud. That's the model we want to have for the Life Sciences at large. One example is Abzena. It's an
interesting company because it's a contract development and manufacturing organizations involved in manufacturingDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL  APR 28, 2021
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9biological drugs, including COVID-19-related one. They had adopted the 3DEXPERIENCE platform with our License to
Cure for biopharma and our ONE Lab solutions, the 2 on the cloud.
So that's, again, some illustrations to highlight the fact that we walk the talk, and the growth strategy we have developed
and presented to you at the Capital Market Day, we are monitoring them with precise KPIs.
Now let's move on the profitability. A few words about our operating margin, which came at 33.9% versus the midpoint
of our guidance, 30.7%, which is 3 points more, if not 4 points more. The results -- the revenue results contributed to 70
basis points of this upside, and the rest is coming from lower-than-expected operating expenses, around 250 basis points.
And just to give you some analysis behind this, half is coming from the travel and the marketing spending restrictions
because we still have many countries where the confinement is still going on. And the other half is coming from a higher
attrition compared and -- combined with the lower hires than expected. So that's probably something I want to draw your
attention on.
The attrition used to be around 5% last year. And for this quarter, we see the attrition moving from 5% to close to 9%,
especially in the United States. So clearly, we will not obviously continue along the same path. So we will accelerate the
hiring in order to offset this attrition level.
Related to the EPS, as I told you, lower-than-planned expenses, combined with the high end of the guidance for the
revenue, led to a significant outperformance of the EPS at EUR 1.14, growth of 20% versus our guidance of between 3%
to 8%.
A few words about the cash flow. We had a very strong Q1, up 40% to EUR 642 million. Net income and noncash items
grew 18%, with the working capital evolution, in particular, nonoperating working capital up sharply, which led to our net
financial debt position at the end of March to EUR 1.5 billion, which is very consistent with the deleveraging plan we have
set up, and we will be almost fully leveraged at the end of the year.
Now let's turn to our 2021 financial objectives. The update following Q1 are straightforward, you can see on the slide,
taking in the OpEx upside and maintaining our revenue at constant currency. So first, we are reconfirming our revenue
objective range of 9% to 10% in constant currency. Inside this, nevertheless, we shift up by 1 point of growth our previous
software range, bringing it to 10% to 11% growth. And for services, we shift down, bringing the servicing growth to 4%
to 6% growth, removing about a little bit more than EUR 20 million, EUR 10 million coming from Q1 and EUR 10 million
additional coming from Q2. We expect H2 performance to be in line with our previous guidance for the services.
The top line growth for this year is essentially an organic one, with all the growth levers aligned with our midterm plan
we shared with you at the time of the Capital Markets Day last year. We also increased our operating margin to 90 basis
points to 31.7%, at the midpoint of the guidance, starting from 30.8%. We see a higher contribution mix, obviously, from
the software revenue as Q1 lockdowns show on-site services work on the other hand as well as the expense timing ramp-
up around travel and [ highs ] on the other side. And finally, we have increased our non-IFRS diluted EPS objectives to
EUR 4.24 to EUR 4.28, leading to expected growth of about 12% to 14% or about 15% to 18% in constant currency,
capturing the earnings upside from Q1. At the midpoint of the range, this represents an upgrade of EUR 0.14, comprised
of EUR 0.02 contribution from the revenue and EUR 0.12 from lower OpEx Q1 and Q2 adjustments I just described.
And finally, with respect to Q2, we are targeting a revenue of EUR 1.130 billion to EUR 1.155 billion, growing, excluding
currency effects, between 12% to 14%, with software growth expected between 12% and 15% driven by a very strong
license growth between 29% and 38%; recurring software revenue growth between 9% to 10%; and the services growth
between 3% to 8%. This lead to an operating margin of between 29.4% to 30.1% and an EPS between EUR 0.94 to EUR
0.98.
To summarize, I think we had solid start to 2021 in financial terms. And looking at the growth in our largest industries, the
strength in 2 or 3 product lines, definitely improving the dynamics of some of the large geos, and we have seen this.
We look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming days and weeks for virtual roadshow and conference. And I
think Bernard and I would like to take and answer your questions.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL  APR 28, 2021

Two or three, if I may. First of all, cloud. You're right, we love this topic. 18.5% penetration now. And of course, Medidata
is a chunk of that. Can you say also where your strongest demand is otherwise? So for example, by industry, by client
size, by software product type. Sort of interested in that.
Second question, data analytics and simulation seem to be particularly strong. Maybe just talk about who your competition
is there and what your unique angle is. And I think you mentioned embedded science functionality. So we'd love to sort of
dig in on that.
And then sorry, third question, just you're a challenger in construction. You say Bouygues, of course, is a great reference
customer. Maybe where else are you making inroads? And is there an opportunity in China and Asia? Sorry, that's quite a
few, sorry.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Stacy. We share the answers with Pascal. If I may start, Pascal, on the cloud. On the cloud, yes, you're right,
I think the dynamic is strong with both Centric PLM. Don't forget that. Centric PLM on Medidata platform. We also had a
very successful dynamic with 3DEXPERIENCE WORKS, especially when we provide now SIMULIA work, SIMULIA on
the cloud for SOLIDWORKS desktop clients. And we have Gian Paolo, CEO of SOLIDWORKS, who is out putting his
arms around 3DEXPERIENCE WORKS at large is really creating a strong dynamic.
To be very precise, in the past, there were a lot of competitors connecting to the SOLIDWORKS base, which is a huge
base. And clearly, the fact that now -- we don't want to leave that plate for someone else. And I think the cloud is really
in a strong dynamic for that. So basically, simulation, project management, project management for the -- what we call
mainstream market are really levers that we see playing a great role going forward for cloud.
Construction, we are doing everything to make it cloud-only because we want to be on the construction site. There is
no good solution on cloud for construction site, believe it or not. Distributing a drawing on the PC is not like providing
the entire sequence for construction on the cloud through a browser. That's what I just said for fun, but when you do
from a phone airplay on a big TV, it's very different than having to get a PC on the construction site. And the guys on the
construction, they love it. So we think that the 15,000 ambition in relatively short term for users for Bouygues quantify this
quite well.
To touch your question about the construction, of course, China is important, very important. I think we have to accelerate
cloud. We have amazing showcase on-premise, but I don't think the on-premise is the best solution for construction.
It should be cloud, basically cloud-only. So we are going to redirect our focus, which means to have cloud operator in
China that are based in China. We have a good position there and more to come there. I cannot mention too much at this
point in time. But I think if we can have a Chinese-based cloud with the proper thrust, I think it will accelerate from that
standpoint.
On the data analytics, on the data analytics, we were doing a lot, but unfortunately, we were not articulating well our
offer. So there was a lot, as you've implied, functionalities but not suitable with the different type of users. So now we are
making this clear for supply chain managers, for buyers, for cost analytics, for waste analytics, and we are systematically
creating what we call analytics roles, which fits with the way people work in their industries. And I don't remember -- I
think I mentioned that for -- in the case of JLR, for example, more than half of the 3DEXPERIENCE roles are exploiting
analytics.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL  APR 28, 2021

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11So we believe that because the data are there, because they are connected, because it's easy, because it's web-based,
mobile, even when you have it on-premise, it's web-based and mobile, we believe we can leverage that. So that's in short
what I wanted to say. Pascal, please don't hesitate to add.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
No. Maybe one comment I could add on the cloud because you touch the product line and the industry, but if I look at the
manufacturing industry, we are seeing traction of the cloud solutions in auto and aerospace. And the traction is coming
from the newcomers because the vast majority of them, they are starting straightforward with the cloud solutions. And it's
not insignificant. It's really -- it starts to become material for us.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mohammed Moawalla calling from Goldman Sachs.
Mohammed Essaji Moawalla
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
I have 2 questions from my end. One, Pascal, maybe you can help us understand this dynamic that you saw around the
recurring revenues shifting more towards license or CapEx purchasing. Just I guess help us understand, given the shift
in the broader industry towards more recurring purchasing, why is this the case? Or are there any sort of circumstances
driving this? And could this just be a temporary or short-term momentum phenomenon?
And then secondly, Bernard, a bigger picture question. As we come out of the pandemic and as you look at the signs of
the sort of cyclical or discretionary demand starting to return, how does this sort of alter the adoption, the conversations
you have with customers around the platform? And to what extent could this be an accelerator as we think beyond just
2021? Where do you see sort of a lot of the big opportunities? And in terms of the actual selling process, to what extent
does it become sort of easier for you?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Mo. Pascal?
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Okay. I will start with the first one. So Mo, you have seen the adjustment I made. So you are right. I mean we see the
CapEx back. It was something where if you look at what's happened in 2020, we didn't have too much last transactions
being CapEx-based. We had some investment, but it was much more focusing on the subscription model. It's mainly
coming from the auto sector. And as you know, traditionally, this sector is a CapEx-based industry more than OpEx-
based. And that's the reason why you have this, you would say, incremental revenue we put in the guidance on the
license, which is almost 5 points.
And on the other side, we have adjusted our recurring revenue by a little bit less than 1 point, which is the equivalent on
the recurring side. It's against -- as I always tell you, we need to have the both model because we have to respect the
business model of our customers. If you take the auto industry, right now, the profitability is at stake for many of them.
They go -- they are not -- they do not have the volume, they have to redesign a lot of their car. I mean, in many countries,
they are in confinement.
So -- but at the same time, it's an industry where you still have to do a lot of investment in order to develop the next
generation of products. And the CapEx is really the way to go. And that's the reason why we still want to give these at
least options to our customers because I think, on the long run, we are their partners. And we are here to help them, not to
constrain them. That's what I can say for this topic.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Related to the platform phenomenon, you're right, there is -- it's really -- there are multiple driving labor here. Acting at
different speed on journey is not the same for all the cases. As Pascal said, there are 3 domains where we see nowDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL  APR 28, 2021
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12systematic adoption of the platform, native, newcomers in industries. And it's not only innovators. It's about really new
commercial sizable companies. That's the driver.
Second driver is, of course, all the sector related to CG, CPG, what we do with consumer goods with Centric, the clinical
trial with Medidata, also the mainstream. And basically, the driver is not SOLIDWORKS itself. It's everything around
SOLIDWORKS: project management, simulation, manufacturing. We plan to have native former IQMS, I mean, meaning
the ERP that Pascal mentioned, what we call DELMIAWORKS, to be native on-cloud platform for the 2022 business,
which is a big tipping point because it's easy to deploy.
Then when it comes to the large clients in manufacturing, of course, construction, it's clear. We basically want to
focus only on cloud mobility because there is no solution today, to tell you the truth. It's quite interesting. And for EV
manufacturing, of course, many of those have gigantic legacy. The Power'By, the Toyota showcase, we think, can be
applicable to -- which is to adopt the platform to connect all the elements together and then to use native platform-based
application in their process. This is a powerful -- for a large customer, a powerful way forward.
So as you can look at it, in every businesses we do with the 3 that Pascal expressed, native cloud, complementary,
we could call it on the edge, and Power'By, we think each time we want to engage systematically with the platform
for all businesses we do. And the acceptance is a good acceptance. I think the limiting factor -- because I understand
your question more about acceleration, the limiting factor is the transformational speed for those clients more than
anything else. I think the solution is robust, mature, they like it. So we probably need to continue to improve that aspect of
conducting those changes with them.
Operator
So your next question comes from the line of Neil Steer calling from Redburn.
Neil Steer
Redburn (Europe) Limited, Research Division
Congratulations on the results. Just 2 questions, if I may. Firstly, you've mentioned the aspiration to have 1/3 of the
software revenues cloud by 2025. Can you give us a sense as to what proportion of those cloud revenues do you expect
to be in the different buckets of cloud-native, extended and connected? And my understanding is that with the growth that
you've got with the sort of the core cloud-native services at the moment within Centric and Medidata, you'll probably get
very close to that 1/3 of software revenues being in the cloud in any case.
And the second question is on the attrition, you mentioned attrition up. Do you know why the attrition went up? And can
you say where specifically and what functions you saw that increase in attrition?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Maybe on cloud, wherever the -- wherever it's possible, we push cloud first systematically. So -- but actually, I think that
the type of customers we have, some of them are not ready for that. So doing what we call private cloud, and I hope this
will be recognized, private cloud will be recognized as cloud, probably it is not really fully factored yet, probably can be
another positive factor.
The private cloud approach is really an interesting approach for clients because we don't want to delegate the
administration, so we really operate for them. But we guarantee -- I mean we have a new level of cybersecurity that many
of them need in having a very precise ISO installation of their environment. So that's probably a factor I did not mention
before, but that has come on top, but it's too early. It's still too early. You are right, mechanically, based on where we are
and what we do now.
I think Pascal Daloz committed for relatively the objective. So probably, we'll have to push him a little bit more.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Neil, next time, please do not ask this kind of question. No, but you're right. I mean when I did love the plan to answer
to your questions, really, what really -- that's more what we call native and edge. I did not factor the ability to probablyDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL  APR 28, 2021

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 13accelerate the transition from on-prem to private cloud. That's something we still have to prove. We have the offer. We
have some good references, but now we need to scale, having the proof point and the economics also with this.
Related to the attrition, clearly, the attrition is increasing, specifically in North America. This is where we see attrition being
back being typically in sales function but also in some G&A function as well.
As far as the research and development is concerned, it's relatively contained. And you will see in the appendix of the
presentation, we are still improving significantly the number of people in research and development.So clearly, we are
keeping the trend we had last year, and we are focusing to a certain extent much more on this right now. But we need to
take care of the attrition [indiscernible].
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Nicolas David calling from ODDO BHF.
Nicolas David
ODDO BHF Corporate & Markets, Research Division
I have 2 actually. The first one is regarding SOLIDWORKS. Obviously, you posted a very strong performance in Q1. First
is a clarification regarding that because I'm not sure I understood well. But you mentioned 18% growth, both in license and
recurring or -- so just -- so could you clarify a little bit of license, please? And do you think that you have reached there
with SOLIDWORKS and maybe also 3DEXPERIENCE that works like an inflection point regarding the adoption of the
solution with VARs and clients being now understanding better the value of the offering? Or do you see something else
there, like exceptional revenue on a region, which is not related to that? So any clarification would be great.
And my second question, I'm sorry, because you announced a lot of great deals during the quarter, but I wanted to talk
about deals signed by one of your competitors, Veeva, which signed a deal with Parexel, apparently a partnership with
Parexel. So could you please comment still? And also mention if you were competing against Veeva to partner with
Parexel also. Any color regarding it would be interesting. And do you think that it will improve the ability of Veeva to
accelerate market share gains in the sector?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Pascal?
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
No, obviously, the 18% is not the same number for the license and the recurring part. I think it was a combination of the
2. And I will not give you the split. Nevertheless, I can give you some insight, which is the following: In volume, number of
units, the growth is double digit. And in value, you could probably add another double digit. Okay.
That's interesting point because, again, as Bernard clearly stated, we are at the point whereby SOLIDWORKS and the
WORKS family, it's a way to establish the footprint, but it's a way also to do the Value Up because with the platform, we
have an integrated environment for many of the company willing to have one set of solution, if you want, do everything
they have to do, and compatibility between all the different pieces. The fact that we have the same experiences, it has
been designed with the same architecture, everything is running on the cloud. It's -- you have all the benefits of usually
what a large company could offer. It's affordable for almost all the enterprises.
This is known, recognized, and we see, as you say, some tractions. And the best, I would say, proof point I have is
the feedback from our resellers because they are the first one to be convinced in our model. And they did great with
the WORKS family, especially on the simulation side. And I just want to remember that it's something we say several
times. The simulation -- the large installed base we have with SOLIDWORKS, we have a lot of competitors who have
addressed this installed base with simulations products, and it's time to stop it. We did all the investment from a research
and development standpoint. We have trained our VAR and now they are walking the talk. So that's also the reason why
you see the value increasing in conjunction with the number of units.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 14On the Parexel, I'm not very familiar with it. We might want to -- Pascal, I don't know if you are familiar.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Parexel is a CRO. Okay. So again, keep in mind, the CROs, they are doing 2 things. They have their own systems to run
the productivity of their clinical research. And they are also sometimes adopting the systems prescribed by the pharma,
the big pharma company. So It's not completely understandable to have Veeva being also used by Parexel time to time.
Nicolas David
ODDO BHF Corporate & Markets, Research Division
But do you think that Parexel will stop selling its internal solution and rely only on Veeva? Or is it just a way to go to 2
solutions?
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Again, part of their business is relying on the demands from the big pharma. And as you've seen, we still have -- having
good tractions with Medidata, and we are continuing to gain market share in the trial. So no, I do not see this as the
beginning of the end.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
To be explicit.
Nicolas David
ODDO BHF Corporate & Markets, Research Division
Congrats on the performance.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Michael Briest calling from UBS.
Michael Briest
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Two from me as well. Pascal, just looking at the software gross margin, it dropped about 200 basis points despite that
strong license performance, and the costs were up about EUR 25 million year-on-year. Can you talk a bit about the
cause and what we should expect for the full year? I'm just wondering, with the sort of 3DEXPERIENCE WORKS for the
SOLIDWORKS space, is that maybe sold more on commission than on a revenue share basis? So you're booking more
of the sale but having to book more costs as well? If you could expand on that.
And then just on disclosure. I mean why are you no longer disclosing the CATIA, ENOVIA and SOLIDWORKS revenue
numbers? I'm assuming that's still pretty important product lines internally. And I mean on ENOVIA, it was minus 11% in
Q1 last year. Can you give a flavor for how it performed this year?
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
So I will start with the last remark. Again, the point behind there is -- we do not want to hide something. We are at the size
whereby if we want to have some financial aggregates, which makes sense, we need to find a way to split the different
revenue by product line, by geo, by industry, to make it understandable. So that's the reason why we simplify by having
the product line industrial software, life science software and mainstream software. That's the reason behind.
CATIA, I gave it to you, it's minus 1%. ENOVIA, it's plus 9%. And SOLIDWORKS, you have it, it's plus 18%. So that's the
point.

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15Related to the software margin...
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
However, CATIA 3DEXPERIENCE is growing 12%, double digit. This is what I think.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Related to the software gross margin, the decrease you have seen is mainly coming from, again, Medidata, because as
you know, the gross margin for Medidata business line is not exactly the same compared to the others because you have
the cost of the cloud. And that's the primary reasons behind this. And on the full year, it's going to be relatively consistent
with what you have seen in Q1.
And the last question was related to 3DEXPERIENCE WORKS, right, Michael?
Michael Briest
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Yes. I guess you're saying that the gross margin is just Medidata, but I was wondering if you were changing the mix of
sales where you -- on SOLIDWORKS. You take just half the revenue -- you take the net revenues and sometimes you
take commission or pay a commission to report gross revenues?
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
No. The only -- I mean that's -- we are still in a cushion base. The only case where we do what you say is when we are
selling SOLIDWORKS to large direct customers. It happens sometimes. And in this case, what we do, we take the full
revenue and we expand the full cost. It's not a commission base. But aside the direct customers, which is limited, we are
not doing this.
François-José Bordonado
Vice-President of Investor Relations
We will take the last question.
Operator
So your last question comes from the line of Julian Serafini calling from Jefferies.
Julian Alexander Serafini
Jefferies LLC, Research Division
So 2 questions to follow up here. On the cloud discussion earlier, I think, Bernard, you talked a lot about construction
of the vertical mainstream as well. If we think, though, about the bigger verticals, right, like Transportation & Mobility or
Aerospace, I mean, is your expectation that they still largely stay on-premise going forward longer term? Is that how you
guys are thinking about it?
And then just second quick question to Pascal. On the attrition, going back to that topic as well, I mean you mentioned,
right, so the marketing and G&A is [ worst to look at ]. I mean, is it something that you understand the cause of and that's
fixed today? Or is that still something that's going on today? And I assume that's involuntary attrition, right, is what you're
talking about?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Julian. On the cloud, clearly, for construction game changer with cloud, mobile first. A&D and T&M, I think
there is clearly all of them are talking to us about private cloud as well as shared cloud for the supply chain. So there are
2 -- actually 2 environments that they like, private cloud for their highly sensitive programs and may come to ecosystem
integration or program using the shared cloud on providing the service to their suppliers. So I think that's probably whereDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL  APR 28, 2021

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16we are going to differentiate in terms of solutions for cyber issues as well as highly sensitive programs where I think it's a
good approach.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Okay. Related to the attritions, yes, you are right. I mean the attrition is not something we are triggering. But not -- my
point is it was very low last year, and suddenly, it came back to where it used to be because in average, if you look at the
past, we have always been around 8%. And if you take an activity like Medidata, they used to exceed 10% attrition on a
regular basis. So clearly, we are back to normal is what I'm saying. And we did not anticipate enough in our hiring offsets.
That was my point.
Now if you look at what we do, I mean, it's -- again, it's normal, I mean, we are in the tech company. We are in the tech
business. We are serving very demanding industries. And usually, we have this outflow, which is a normal way to run
our business. So no, there is no concern, except that we need to reaccelerate the hiring process. That's what's behind
[indiscernible].
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Yes. And we wanted to make sure you understand that we continue to invest.
Okay. With that, thank you very much for participating and for your questions. Of course, we continue to be here. And we
are always here if you have additional questions. Thank you very much, and have a good day.

Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Thank you, François-Jose. Hello, everyone. It's good to have this mid-year review with you for the Dassault Systèmes
2021 second quarter on the full year perspective that, as François-Jose said, I will share with Pascal.
Software revenue was up 15%, you have seen that in the press release I'm sure by now. The license revenue is up 38%
excluding exchange rate. And by the way, all this is organic. On recurring revenue, up 10% excluding exchange rate,
which represent, by the way, 79% of software revenue. And as a result, the EPS is up 35%, would be 45% up of EPS if
we were to exclude the exchange effect.
Basically, we believe that those numbers confirms a few things which are important to us, important to our clients and
partners. The systematic approach to virtualization is becoming now in all industries. And we do use virtualization because
we think it's the next step after a simple digitalization of documents.
And of course, the imperative of sustainable development. We'll come back on this. It's indeed reshaping the innovation
process, and we have very interesting data point on that aspect, too. As as well the inclusiveness, which basically is about
better [ hiring ] people within companies and across virtual enterprise.
We continue to be making the difference with our clients, basically leveraging fully the virtual twin experience on
everything we do, including doing the virtual twin of Dassault Systèmes itself. We believe that it's a game changer for all
sectors of the economy. And we shared with you, with Pascal, early last year that our intent is to be a key player in both
[ MI ], health and infrastructure.
And we are, as a result of that, and Pascal will articulate it, raising our 2021 guidance and targeting EPS growth of about
plus 19% to 21%, which would be 23% to 25% if we were to exclude exchange rate. So some highlights, which basically
are really proof points about our belief. And our belief -- and this is a long-term perspective, our belief is that the virtual
world extend and improve the real world. And I think there are good stories today, as we did first quarter, which are
illustrating this very well.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 27, 2021

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 5The second aspect of it is the platform phenomenon. Its adoption across the board. Its known in retail. And I think it's
going to happen in manufacturing, construction and in health care, too. And this is why we think we are extremely well
positioned with the 3DEXPERIENCE platform to really connect modeling, simulation and data together to really create
what we call the virtual twin of the experience economy. But again here, quite interesting illustrations on that.
Another factor that is well illustrated with numbers this quarter is the dynamic of the mainstream. And the dynamic of the
mainstream market, what we call mainstream market, is really in this inclusiveness of using the platform as a collaborative
platform. And I believe that working together anytime, anywhere from any device, having a browser-based, cloud-based
solutions is very differentiating. And it is a differentiating for -- as a system. We have, of course -- and that's the value of
being browser-based and cloud-based as you can see with our offer. And the dynamic here is very strong.
So China, it is quite interesting second quarter 2021. More than 220 cloud wins in 1 quarter for China. It means we are
trusted. We have the right infrastructure. And this adoption shows that we provide a good secure environment. As you
know, the world of mainstream for us, mainly represented by SOLIDWORKS, is about 1 million-plus commercial users. It's
about 250,000 clients and with an average of 20,000 per year. We believe that this track record will sustain.
And also, an important aspect of mainstream is what about mainstream PLM. I think the illustration this quarter about the
performance of Centric PLM is another asset of this dynamic of adoption of product life cycle management across the
board.
Centric PLM is now reaching about 500 companies 2,000 highly reputable brands are trusting Centric PLM and 99%
retention rate. Most of the customers, above 90%, are accepting to be referenced in their industries. And you see here
the incredible logo dynamic between 2016 to 2021. And as you may remember, we will be buying the remaining share
of Centric PLM this coming August, which means that this is a fully powerful mainstream brand for Dassault Systèmes'
future.
Back to the way we show you the proof points, the reasons to believe. If we look at the 3 sectors of the economy, and we
look at both Manufacturing Industries, Life Sciences & Healthcare and Infrastructure & Cities, let's review what are the
trends there. Clearly, the trends are their commonality: smarter product and services, move from supply chain to value
chain, stable innovation. I see those 3 factors becoming very prominent in those 3 sectors of the economy which are
connected industries together, because high tech is, for example, everywhere. And more to be discussed on that.
Let's review on the first, health sector. Of course, we are very pleased with the Medidata move. The team, on the
cooperation and the integration of Medidata, is going extremely well. Pascal might comment a few things. We are very
proud to announce that Novavax has used the new world of Medidata distributed, decentralized clinical trial. Three studies
involving 45,000 participants were initiated in less than 8 weeks.
I think it's [ really good ]. And I think that it shows that sponsor-based, centralized clinical trials are also moving to
decentralized, meaning that the patients are not in the hospital infrastructure, they are participating from home. This is
thanks to myMedidata and thanks to Medidata Patient Cloud, which are really the expansion of the Medidata brands that
are really proving to be work best solutions.
At this point in time, just for information, we have about 400 related clinical trial in -- regarding the COVID-19, so it's not
stopping. And I hope, at the end, this will -- we will be able to stop this pandemic, which is rather complex today in the
world. But the point is decentralized Medidata expansion in portfolio, fast adoption, platform-based on mega studies.
Another good illustration in health is LabCorp Drug Development, adopting Medidata Sensor Cloud. This is a quite
interesting approach. It's basically IoT for health. Sensor Cloud is about taking this acquisition of data in a seamless
way, collect those data for clinical trials. I believe that this sector will also evolve quickly with very smart med tech --
personalized med tech.
Digital biomarker discovery, the first project will be an at-home version of the Six Minute Walk Test that you can read it
-- read here. And we are very excited to have this infrastructure leveraging MC10 acquisition, you remember this small
acquisition we announced a few weeks ago, playing a key role. We see that as a major avenue for fast acquisition IoT-
based on the platform of personalized data in a very structural and professional way that we call clinical trial.
And another proof point here in another sector of consumer package and production is Boticário Group, which is adopting
the 3DEXPERIENCE platform. It's a leading beauty company and world largest beauty franchise. It's well known because
they are known for using natural ingredients. And the business value that they are really seeing here is really aboutDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 27, 2021

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 6transforming their manufacturing processes, reducing inventory costs and defect, managing irregular products supply,
improving the compliance, and of course, all this contributing to competitiveness.
And the solution we sold them, the industry solution, is called Perfect Production, which I think is the right naming for this
kind of -- we noticed that in the fast-moving consumer goods, the reformulation area is a massive priority for sustainable
justification.
Another illustration is in the manufacturing sector is Alstom adopting the 3DEXPERIENCE platform to really integrate
worldwide -- recent acquisition of Bombardier, for example, and they are adopting a cloud platform for all their PLM for
-- across the group. They have -- the rollout is happening this year on -- throughout 2021 and 2022. And we will reach at
least 15,000 cloud-based 3DEXPERIENCE platform users.
So basically, they are exploiting 3 industry solutions, the one we call Smart, Safe & Connected. This is for system -- on
cyber system. Global Modular Architecture, it says what it does. And Lean Production Run, which is about optimizing
production system.
The last 2 remarks on that sector is in the High Tech, HONOR expands SIMULIA adoption. Well-known brand. It's
a spinoff of Huawei, and they do smartphone, tablets, laptops, wearable. They are accelerating their go-to-market,
improving their R&D process, including the value chain. And they are using multiphysics simulation for all their product
integration. High Tech has been a good dynamic, I think Pascal will make some remark later on, on that, in this quarter.
And related to the evolution of flow management. The example of DELMIA Quintiq for KiwiRail is a good example of how
we can improve global service and fleet management and crew planning. And this is an excellent illustration to improve
visibility of operations; improve health and safety and sustainability of the system; and of course, improve the utilization of
their assets, in this case the wagon assets; and improve business agility to provide fast answer to the demand in a very
disrupted world, especially in the context of the pandemic and in the context of supply issues in many, many area of the
world. And it improves our profitability.
Before I talk about sustainability, I think we have a small video for you. So François-José, please launch the video.
[Presentation]
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
So this is a short video that illustrates the importance of the role we can play, what we call handprint role we can play,
contributing to sustainable innovation for the world in all sectors of the economy we are serving. And we are also applying
this digital twin for ourselves, of course, with what we call Science Based Targets. It was approved, and we published our
engagement on that with -- for net zero emission, with a time line which is now set up.
SBTi is important because there is a lot of situation and a lot of statements about sustainability. I think having it being
science-based is important. We believe that this has the merit of accelerating also the value of a PLM approach so people
can understand what is happening in their businesses.
So we have announced that we will reach the net zero by 2040 via carbon removal projects, which is very key. But we can
debate about the fact that should it be 2040 or 2035, I think we will report regularly on our progress there. But I think being
science-based provide a rigor and a professional approach to it, and helps our customers find out the way they should
approach for their own business. And we believe that the 3DEXPERIENCE platform is a key catalyst and an enabler for
these 2 efforts.
So we think that in this area we are transforming all our industry solution space. So they will include as we go -- and we
are going to make available on the market, what we call the 2022x around the end of the year, 2022 market. We are
integrating solution, many things. Sustainable design, we have a good illustration with Nabtesco or with Amcor Rigid
Plastics here for sustainable design.
Sustainable production, with Amy's kitchen, for example, where they are really transforming using the platform. On
sustainable experience, good illustration with NIO, electrical vehicle innovator in China; or Eviation aircraft, or new type of
electrical airplane for a mid-range distance. So a lot of projects, whether in formulation, packaging, industrial equipment,
home equipment or production, where the illustrations of our handprint can be measured and is tangible.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 27, 2021

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7So we believe that we are executing to plan. And people are joining Dassault Systèmes because they love the purpose of
Dassault Systèmes to provide the 3DEXPERIENCE universe to imagine sustainable innovation capable of harmonizing
product, nature and life. And I believe, more than ever, with the last quarters, we have been illustrating that.
And with that, Pascal, you have the floor and provide the necessary numbers.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Thank you, Bernard. Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining us today.
So turning to our financial performance. I think we delivered strong second quarter results, thanks to the broad-based
growth across regions and product lines. Total revenue increased 14% year-over-year to EUR 1.16 billion at the top of
our 12% to 14% range. Software revenue in its component also came in at the high end of our objectives, with an organic
software growth region, reaching EUR 1.1 billion.
License and other revenue rose 38% to EUR 223 million during the quarter. And looking at the first half, we are now back
to 2019 levels, which I think it's something very important. Subscription and support revenue increased 10% year-over-
year, driven by subscription growth of 18%. And as Bernard said, the recurring revenue represented 79% of the software
revenue this quarter.
Services revenue was up 5%, finally back to growth, year-over-year of course, and show a significant sequential
improvement, as you can see. We achieved also services growth margin in the double digits, also substantially better
versus last year because you remember last year, we took many, many actions in order to preserve the profitability
despite the lack of activity.
Finally, the 3DEXPERIENCE and cloud revenue both performed well, growing 26% year-over-year. From a profitability
standpoint, lower than -- lower-than-planned expenses, sorry, combined with revenue at the high end of the guidance led
to a significant outperformance in operating margin and earnings per share. As you can see, our operating margin came in
at 32.2% and EPS grew 35% or 45% in constant currency to EUR 0.22 compared to our guidance of 18% to 23%.
Now let's move to the software revenue by regions. The Americas grew 19% this quarter, benefiting from a strong
performance in Life Sciences & Healthcare, High Tech and Transportation & Mobility. And now the Americas represents
39% of the non-IFRS software revenue. Europe increased 13%, led by Southern Europe and totaled 36% of the total
software revenue. Asia also rose 13%. Within the region, we saw continued strength of China -- from China, which grew
24%, and continued also software in Japan.
Zooming now in our product lines, the second quarter performance. Industrial Innovation software revenue rose 8%
to EUR 571 million. To be noted that CATIA, the world-leading solution in product design and modeling experiences,
delivered sales growth of 9%, punctuated by CATIA cyber system. NETVIBES in the data intelligence and ENOVIA in
collaborations also benefited from positive business trend during the periods.
Zooming in Life Sciences, software revenue amounts for EUR 218 million, an increase of 22%. We continue to see a
strong momentum across Medidata product portfolio, including Medidata Rave, Medidata Patient Cloud and also Medidata
Acorn AI. As well as what we call the attach rates, because you know we have the core module but you have also another
-- a lot of solutions surrounding those core modules.
Medidata is also establishing itself as a leader in decentralized clinical trial. And you know this trend is becoming
significant for this industry. And we are uniquely positioned because not only we have a set of solutions to connect the
patients, but we also have all the back-end systems in order to connect with the [ sponsor ], which is unique on the
market. And that's the reason why, as Bernard said, in many of the new trials, we are winning the market share. And trust
me, in many, many cases, we are also displacing Veeva.
In the Mainstream Innovation, software revenue rose 27% to EUR 262 million. And within the Mainstream, the
SOLIDWORKS software revenue rose 25% with the 3DEXPERIENCE WORKS family. The cloud-based solutions sales
also up sharply during the period. And finally, Centric PLM delivered an excellent performance, posting near triple-digit
growth and continue to take market share against the traditional players in this space. And at the same time, we are also
expanding outside of the fashion industry, in food and beverage, in the high tech, in all the cosmetics, also becoming a
significant segment for Centric PLM.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 27, 2021

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8Now let's review our key growth strategy, on both 3DEXPERIENCE and cloud, and how we are progressing relatively
to the objective we laid out during the 2020 Capital Markets Day. Our 3DEXPERIENCE strategy incorporates 2 axis
of growth. With value up, we are increasing the value we bring to our existing customers. And with value wide, we are
extending our venue to new customers.
As I mentioned, 3DEXPERIENCE sales grew 26% during the quarter and now represent 25% of the total software
revenue, an increase of almost 200 basis points relatively to last year. Importantly, the 3DEXPERIENCE drove a number
of significant large client wins during the period, reflecting into the 55% growth of the license in the beginning of the year.
Turning to the cloud. Cloud adoption is another cornerstone of our strategy and a further opportunity to expand our depth
and breadth of our clients. Our cloud contribution, representing 19% of the total software revenue, a 2-point increase
relatively compared to last year. And you may recall that last year, based on our end-market sector, we set the goal to
reach EUR 2 billion in cloud software revenue by 2025, and this would represent an estimated of 1/3 of the total software
revenue.
In terms of cloud strategy, we value the long term, it's one of our specific G&A we have, and the strategic relationship we
have with our clients. As such, our cloud strategy is set to meet our clients where they are in the context of the industry
and whether they are the starting point from them. That's the reason why we are offering 3 different cloud path.
Native on the cloud for the new customers, so specifically all the start-ups like the EV guys. The extended, mixing both on-
premise and on the cloud solutions when you want to complement a large installation you have with new capabilities, new
solutions. For example, what we do in the simulation. And Power'By, with an on-premise software solution, specifically
SOLIDWORKS Desktop and CATIA V5 connected to our 3DEXPERIENCE platform on the cloud for collaboration and
data intelligence.
To be noted, and this is I think very important for you, that we released 21x. We are now -- we have now more roles on
the cloud than we have on premise. And we expect this trend to continue and be reinforced in the future.
Let's move to the operating margin. So as I say to you, from a profitability standpoint, the lower-than-planned expenses
combined with the revenue at the high end of the guidance led to a significant outperformance in operating margin.
Our operating margin came at 32.2% versus the midpoint of our guidance of 29.7%. And this demonstrates an
overperformance of almost 250 basis points. This was driven in part by the combination of the expenses and head count
tailwinds we discussed with you last quarter.
Our head count was stable year-over-year as hiring was offset by attrition, and that was higher than planned but in line
with 2019 levels. Within research and development, we experienced a mid-single-digit net gains in terms of new team
members. We have adjusted our hiring capacity and we expect to more than offset the attrition in the coming quarter.
That's very important.
All this good performance is obviously translating into an EPS growth of 35% to 45% in constant currency to EUR 1.09
presplit or EUR 0.22 post-split and compared to our guidance of 18% to 23%.
Now let's move to the cash flow and the balance sheet, and turning back to our financial performance and to our balance
sheet items. The year-to-date cash flow from operation rose 21% relative to last year. EUR 1.030 billion. Keep in mind that
last year, it took us 3 months to overachieve EUR 1 billion. So in 6 months, we have been capable to deliver EUR 1 billion
cash flow.
Our deferred revenue, now called contract liability, rose 17% in constant currency, which is relatively consistent with the
operations. And finally, our net financial debt position at the end of June decreased by EUR 768.3 million to less than EUR
1.2 billion debt, putting us on track to reach our deleveraging plan goals probably somewhere early next year, which is
almost 6 months, if not 9 months, ahead of the schedule.
Moving now to the M&A section, a few things to be noticed this quarter. In July, we acquired a French start-up called
iterop, an innovative SaaS company leveraging BPMN 2.0 standards, which is nothing more than a neutral graphical
language, to provide business processes solution. Let me explain the rationale behind this.
So first of all, you know our platform is not only a technology to power our roles and solutions or design manufacturing
engineering, but it's also when you use a platform without the roles, a powerful business platform, enabling the virtual twin
of the enterprise and transforming document-based processes into experiences.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 27, 2021
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9iterop's technology will complement the Dassault Systèmes' approach to empowering clients with effortless migrations
from documents to experiences. And together, Dassault Systèmes and iterop will enhance the 3DEXPERIENCE platform
and the 3DS Outscale because we will combine this technology with both to give the ability to leverage when it's fully
integrated with 3DEXPERIENCE platform or as a stand-alone services with 3DS Outscale.
Turning to Centric PLM, Bernard said a few words about it, but we plan to complete our acquisition of Centric early this
fall without a significant incremental cash payment. So you may remember that we initiated a 63% equity stake in Centric
in July 2018. And we are more than happy to finalize our partnership and continue to execute against Centric PLM's
substantial opportunity in consumer industry.
And we are very pleased of what we did not only in terms of integration, but the ability to diversify Centric PLM far ahead
of the traditional fashion industry. And the momentum you have seen recently is really the demonstration that this strategy
is working. So Chris and team, you did a great job.
Turning now to our 2021 financial objective. We expect the current business environment and profitability trends to persist
in the second half. As a result, we are raising our fiscal year 2021 revenue growth objective range to EUR 4.745 billion to
EUR 4.790 billion, incorporating, obviously, the second quarter outperformance and greater visibility adding approximately
EUR 10 million in software revenue coming from Medidata specifically. Our new objective represent an increase of 10% to
11% revenue growth versus the 9% to 10% previously.
We expect operating margin in the range of 32.7% to 33.1% versus 31.6% to 31.7% previously. I want to remind you
all that because of the pandemic we implemented the cost-saving plan in the second quarter last year, and we expect
the expense and the head count tailwinds we have experienced to dissipate in the coming quarter as we resume travel,
increase sales and marketing spending and also accelerate the net gains in hirings.
We have raised, finally, our non-IFRS diluted EPS objective range to EUR 0.99 (sic) [ EUR 0.89 ] to EUR 0.91 on a
split-adjusted basis or 23% to 25% from 17% to 18% in constant currency. This is capturing the earnings upside from
the second quarter, the increased visibility we have, specifically coming from Medidata and the lower-than-expected
expenses. You will find more details about the full year objective as well for our third quarter guidance in the earnings
press release and in the presentation deck.
Now I think it's time to conclude before to take the questions. And I have a few messages I want to remind. So first of
all, we are encouraged by the demand and we are seeing across our product lines and regions. We believe many of
these trends are underpinned by secular drivers, as Bernard said -- highlight today, including virtualization, sustainability,
inclusive environment. So those trends are really driving the demand and the transformation in many industries.
With our 3DEXPERIENCE platform, we began to preparing for these trends over a decade ago. And as such, we are
greatly positioned to help our clients to address these new imperatives well into the future. And finally, we succeed when
our clients are succeeding. And we -- I really want to take an opportunity, we want to take an opportunity, to thank all of
our clients for their ongoing partnership and our employees also for the hard work they did and their dedications on our
success.
Lastly, we expect to resume in-person meetings with the investment community this fall, and I hope to see you again on
the road.
So I think Bernard and I are now ready to take and answer your question.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Adam Wood from Morgan Stanley.
Adam Dennis Wood
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Bernard, Pascal, congratulations are a very strong quarter. I've got 2, please. The first one just on the margins. Obviously,
it's great to see your margin upside in the quarter, but I think we all know you want to invest for the future. Could you just
talk a little bit about relaxed you are about being able to make up for the attrition in the second half of the year and if there
are any implications for next year's margins, given how strong the margin improvement is going to be this year?
And then secondly, maybe a bigger-picture question. I think when we've discussed in the past around the pace of growth
at Dassault, one of the restrictions has been client's ability to take a certain amount of change in the business and a
reluctance to change, they're only willing to take so much risk on in any 1 year. As you look back over the last 12 months,
do you think there's been some change there, the companies now are being -- are willing to be more aggressive and want
to transform more quickly? And how does the focus on sustainability drive into that? Does that kind of accelerate that
desire to change?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Adam. Pascal, you want to take the question?
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Okay. So you are right, Adam, the head count has been a topic. Even if we did much better compared to Q1 because
we hired almost 800 more -- a little bit more than 800 persons in Q2 compared to 400 in Q1. However, the attrition was
almost offsetting this number. So coming back to the second half, I have slightly increased the capacity in terms of hiring
in order to reach between 900 to 1,000 per quarter. And I do expect to contain the attrition to roughly 500 per quarter.
That's the goal.
Related to the margin for next year, probably a little bit early to discuss it. But I thank you for the questions, nevertheless,
because I do not want you to draw the conclusion that we are capable to maintain the 33% margin, we will expand this
year or the coming years. So for next year, I do expect to be much more in the range of 31.8% to 32%. It's slightly below
compared to this year because, your point, we need to reinvest especially to strengthen the sales team and also to give
more capacity in research and development in certain areas.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
The second -- Adam, thank you for the second question related to our clients taking new risk in terms of transforming
themselves thanks to platform on the digitalization and virtualization. I think eyes are opening. Eyes are opening about the
fact that sustainability has significant impact, number one. The need to better understand which materials to use, which
fabrics to use, which new process should be put in place, which new formulation for the related product, can I do smarter
products so they are better optimized throughout their life cycle.
And the last point is about the bill across the life cycle, the eco bill across the life cycle. I think the situation has never
been as good to help understand what PLM is about because it stands for product life cycle management. Up to now,
PLM has been adopted to create a digital reference of what you do and how you do it. I think going forward, PLM will be
used to do the virtual eco bill of the full cycle. Regulators are accelerating this trend.
Now conducting those transformations are very complex, Adam. And I think we are the catalyst and the enabler of this to
happen. It's going to take time. However, I believe that many of the decisions which we reflected on to my presentation
and Pascal's presentation are truly driven from that perspective. So it's there to last and we will see the implication for
2022, but we are comfortable of the dynamic -- the new dynamic it can create.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 27, 2021
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11The last remark is, clearly, in our mind, in my mind, the supply chain is moving to value chain. And this is really deep. This
is not about optimizing just the one-on-one -- well, in one-to-one relationship, it's about optimizing the total. No one does
that well today. We believe we can do it with the platform.
So good drivers. We will come back every quarter to illustrate why what we call our handprint to help be the catalyst and
the enabler for that are happening. But I think the showcase -- the orientation we gave today are confirming exactly the
positive trend toward your question, Adam.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Stacy Pollard from JPMorgan.
Stacy Elizabeth Pollard
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
A few from me. First of all, on mainstream, what percentage of new customers are purchasing cloud now? And really, I
guess, I should ask the same question for new purchases in the industrial sector, too. Perhaps it's a different dynamic
there, but the cloud question. Number two, on 3DEXPERIENCE, 25% of software revenues now. What would you expect
that to be in, say, 3 years? And then third question, as you delever, at what point could we see larger, more transformative
M&A?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Stacy. Pascal on the cloud?
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Yes. As you may know, SOLIDWORKS is almost gaining 50,000 -- between 50,000 to 60,000 new customers every
year. And right now, if I do the math, it's probably around 10% starting with the cloud. China, only in 1 quarter, 220 new
customers. So with this, I think you have a good order of magnitude, and this is accelerating.
For the industrial sector, I don't know if we should take the same approach. Because the question is not too much
about the footprint, much more about the transformation. I think what could be noticed is we see more and more large
incumbent companies moving to the cloud. You have seen Alstom is a good example of this. They're using it as a way to
decommission the legacy system to standardize, to facilitate the integration. And as Bernard said, also to redefine what
we used to call the value chains, much more along to the value network because the cloud is giving this flexibility to do it.
So you could expect to see more and more large companies moving with the cloud architecture and solutions. And I think
with all the different sets of solutions we have, whatever it's a cloud you can share with others, or a dedicated cloud or
a sovereign card, I think we have the full range of different solutions in order to answer to all the different needs coming
from the industrial sectors.

Can you explain the dynamic adoption across the board?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Clearly, to Pascal's point, the cloud portfolio is now overpassing the on-premise portfolio. Number two, the cloud portfolio
is the future for mainstream. It's the current situation for Centric PLM. It is the current situation for Medidata using those
platform-based approach, mainstream is also. Pascal mentioned the trend with 3DEXPERIENCE for large companies and
[ moving into cloud ].
So there is no doubt in our mind that it simplifies everything. And the mechanics, to address your question about
3DEXPERIENCE adoption, is as customers adopt a wider portfolio on the new generation, 3DEXPERIENCE is a
condition, even on on-premise. So the dynamics should continue to be very strong from that standpoint. We need to doDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 27, 2021

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12well. And what we are focusing now is making sure that the 3DEXPERIENCE platform can integrate customer legacy's
data on legacy tools, which are not necessarily our own software, to help them go to a platform approach.
So those 2 factors are the strong factors. In a certain horizon, 3DEXPERIENCE is just a platform for every aspect of every
solutions of Dassault Systèmes on the longer term. So at some point in time, it will be reaching the prerequisite of platform
infrastructure for everything we sell.
Stacy Elizabeth Pollard
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
No, that's helpful.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
And the last question around...
Stacy Elizabeth Pollard
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Yes, which is M&A.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
You asked another question, which was the last one related to M&A, right?
Stacy Elizabeth Pollard
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Yes.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
So obviously, we will not answer to these questions during the call. Nevertheless, you are raising a good point. Because
with the ability to deleverage the company and being almost in a position to have no any more debt somewhere early
next year, this has given us the freedom not only to do the bolt-on acquisitions, the -- what we do with reinforcing our
capabilities, continuing to infuse innovations with start-ups, but also to consider a significant expansion. And I think it's
going to be a good topic for the Capital Markets Day next year.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Yes.
Stacy Elizabeth Pollard
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
I will ask it again.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Welcome. Welcome, Stacy.

And your next question comes from the line of Michael Briest from UBS.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 13Very strong performance in Medidata, so 22% in the first half. I think previously you were looking for 14% growth in the
year and, Pascal, I think you said the EUR 10 million increase for H2 relates to Medidata. I mean that's about 3 points of
full year growth, so what are you actually expecting for Medidata this year? And then somewhat related, just if I take out
the cloud revenues from recurring software, I get about 6% growth. Do you think that's a rate that you can improve upon in
2022 and beyond as the rest of the business, if you like, gets back to a healthier shape?
And then Bernard, just on the sort of Infrastructure & Cities market, and Stacy was asking about M&A, but we haven't
seen a lot of progress there. Can you give us an update? And then maybe around Altium, I think that their talks with
Autodesk finished recently. How important is that relationship with them around the sort of 3DEXPERIENCE side,
because I think you're looking to advance that 6 or 12 months ago?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Michael. Pascal, Medidata.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
I will start with the first one. So you're right, Medidata did an outstanding performance H1. But remember, H2 last year
was much better compared to H1 last year. Because if you remember, the revenue increased almost from 13% to more
than 18%. So I do expect to continue to have a good performance. But the base will, to a certain extent, lower the growth
of Medidata in H2. So that's the reason why if you -- if I come back to the previous guidance I gave to you, the 15% range,
and now I'm much more targeting 16% plus. That's what we are talking about.
Related to the cloud, against -- the core -- the key thing for us is not only -- is really not to measure too much the
contribution from a revenue standpoint, even if I set the target, it's much more related to the footprint. In the footprint, we
have different KPI to measure it. One is, obviously, the number of users. And the second one is the volume of data we
have in our cloud. Because at the end, this is what it's about.
Cloud is, on one hand, the inclusiveness, the ability to connect as much as people as you can. And on the other hand is
the ability to leverage the data to the artificial intelligence, analytics. And that's the real things we are tracking. And what
I can say on those 2 items, it's a triple-digit growth we are seeing. So if this is going the way we want, to answer to your
question, Michael, automatically, the revenue will come and the extra growth coming on top of Medidata will be there.
What I can say is we are betting a lot on the new 3DEXPERIENCE WORKS family to trigger this growth because we
have reasons to believe that the market adoption is extremely good. We are seeing some proof point in regions of the
world. Bernard mentioned China, but we have others. And as I was saying also to Stacy, we see also large transactions
moving to the cloud. It was not the case probably 1.5 years ago. This also will contribute to accelerate the percentage. So
if you compare to last year, it's 2 points in addition in terms of mix coming from the cloud. And I do expect these trends to
continue to be -- to reinforce and maybe to slightly accelerate over the next 2 to 3 years.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Related to Infrastructure & Cities, thank you, Michael, for putting this topic. As you know, it's the third big topic for Dassault
Systèmes in addition to the world of the making and the world of help. Projects are very near. They are transformational.
They are all on cloud, both for city and construction. It's related to not only the engineering and design, but related to the
construction test itself. So the dynamic is a good dynamic.
We are -- I think this sector is looking for a platform-based, cloud-based infrastructure everywhere around the world.
China is a good driver for us. On Europe, with not only the BWIG showcase, but now the BWIG showcase is expanding
with all the project partners. Because this sector is a very project -- it should be known, but better to say it, it's project-
driven. It's not only company-driven, it's consortium-driven.
And we now notice that, thanks to our friends from BWIG, there are multiple new consortium being set up to offer
remodeling of certain set of cities or infrastructure for energy distribution in cities. We call that the hydrogen or electrical
plugs that needs to be installed. And we have many projects on that, that are connecting the territory management, what
we call [ SOLIDWORKS City ] on the project management, which is related to the use of the platform to construct what
needs to be constructed.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 27, 2021

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 14So I believe we are here to create this game-changer approach. Like what we did, we did it on mock-up 30 years ago in
the manufacturing sector. It takes time, but I don't -- I think it will last. So we'll come back regularly to tell you -- to share
with you new wins in this area. And by the way, I am convinced that the size of installations can be at least equivalent to
very large manufacturing clients in terms of both revenue and number of users. And what we're communicating on BWIG
is already a proof point of that, and all being subscription-based, cloud-based, which is our priority right now. So that's all
what I can say.
Related to Alstom, of course, we -- when -- back 2 years ago, we decided that we should have a multiple approach.
We have a great partnership with Cadence with synergies. We have a partnership with also the Japanese player. Our
customers like it. And as you know for everything related to wiring, packaging, this is going to be made in the platform.
And when it comes to chips and boards, we will use third-party integration. Those third-party integration are going
very well. I must say that the situation will -- that come with the recent news flow, accelerated our strategy to have
multiple options, which was already the case, but I think it has strengthened the relationship with the other players for the
satisfaction of our clients. That's all what I can say at the current time.
Operator
And your last question comes from the line of Nicolas David from ODDO BHF.
Nicolas David
ODDO BHF Corporate & Markets, Research Division
Two questions, actually. First one is will you please provide us some color regarding the, yet again, very strong growth of
SOLIDWORKS in Q2, is it again mainly due to the 3DEXPERIENCE WORKS strategy you already mentioned? Or more
this time kind of the back catalog thing? And any color regarding the average deal size increase and also the trends for H2
would be helpful.
And my second question is regarding Industrial Innovation. sorry about that, but this is maybe the only area where you're
still slightly below '19 level in Q2. My question is, which sectors and brands are still below '19 level? And should we expect
a catch-up in this area? Or do you think that there is some brands and sectors which have taken a hit that will be difficult
to recover soon?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Nicolas. Just a remark on the SOLIDWORKS growth. It's now visible for the market, I'll let Pascal provide
data, but it's now recognized by the market that the 3D -- all SOLIDWORKS portfolio in the next less than 2 years will
be based on the 3DEXPERIENCE platform. That's including -- so all including the desktop collaborative process will be
cloud-based, platform-based environment connecting to the desktop. So that's the trend.
And it has significant consequences because it means that there is a higher [ credit ], higher consistency because the
next-generation SOLIDWORKS is based natively on the 3DEXPERIENCE platform. All the roles and processes which are
part of the Dassault Systèmes-wide gigantic catalog will be compatible on that point. That's the context in the next 18 to
24 months, in 2023. And with that, Pascal, I'll let you comment about the dynamic between desktop and 3DEXPERIENCE
WORKS.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Okay. So this quarter, and to a certain extent since the beginning of the year, Nicolas, I would say 2/3 of the growth is
coming from the volume. So the ability -- I mean, the desktop solutions. It's partially a catch-up because last year, you
remember, was soft. And also, the growth drivers for SOLIDWORKS is still there. I mean you still have a significant
number of people migrating from 2D to 3D every year. And we are capturing, if you remember, almost half of them. So the
rest is coming from the WORKS family, which is some incremental growth.
And last but not least, which is probably the most important and you are right to ask the average deal size, we have -- we
are seeing some increase and it's coming from the mix. We see more and more SOLIDWORKS users buying additional
simulation seats, expanding into the PDM area or connecting with manufacturing capabilities. So this is also what is
reflected into this excellent performance of SOLIDWORKS.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 27, 2021
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15Coming back to Industrial Innovations, I would say there are a few things. Because at the end, the question is not what is
going well but what could be better. So what could be better? I think DELMIA could have been better for the first half of
the year. I do expect, given the pipeline we have, that DELMIA will be -- will have a much better performance. So DELMIA
is around the mid-single digit. It should probably be much more a double-digit growth. So that's what I'm expecting in H2
as a recovery. Aside of this, ENOVIA is growing at 10%. NETVIBES, more than 50% for this quarter. [ ENOVIA ] is also
growing at double digits. So clearly, all the components are extremely good.
From an industry standpoint, I think there are a few where we are not seeing yet the strong momentum in this sector. But I
will mention at least 2. The first one is the Marine & Offshore markets. We grew significantly the last 2 years, and the first
half has been relatively soft. And the second one is the Industrial Equipment. We have seen a lot of traction coming from
the mainstream markets. However, for the large equipment, we are not yet back to where we used to be in '19. So we'll
still have some progress we can make on this front. And I hope the investment cycle will be back also in this.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
So thank you, everyone, for participating to this call. I hope that you find useful information, and we continue to take this
with high level of integrity as -- needless to say, we will host a conference call this afternoon. And we are always there for
you with the investor team whenever you have additional questions.
Thank you, and have a great day and a great summer if you have not taken a summer break yet.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Dassault Systèmes 2021 Q3 Earnings Presentation.
[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to François Bordonado. Please go ahead, sir.
François-José Bordonado
Vice-President of Investor Relations
Thank you, Roberto. Good morning, everyone. This is François Bordonado speaking, Dassault Systèmes Investor
Relations. From the company, we have Bernard Charles, our Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Pascal
Daloz, Chief Operations Officer and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to welcome you to Dassault Systèmes Third
Quarter and 9 first months of 2021 webcast presentation. At the end of the presentation we'll take questions from
participants. Later today, we'll also hold a conference call. Dassault Systèmes results are prepared in accordance with
IFRS. Most of the financial figures in this conference call are presented on a non-IFRS basis, with revenue growth rates in
constant currency unless otherwise noted.
For an understanding of the differences between the IFRS and non-IFRS, please see the reconciliation tables included in
our press release. Some of the comments we'll make during today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements,
which could differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our risk factors in our 2020 document d’enregistrement
universel. I will now hand over to Bernard Charles.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Thank you, François-José. A good quarter, as you have noticed already, thanks to all the team and especially Pascal. The
Q3 total revenue is up 12% on a broad-base. Really, about 90% of the coverage of our revenue is growing double digits.
So it's a very healthy balance of sorts of revenue. The new license revenue is up 24% and the EPS is reaching a healthy
40%. For the full year, if you look at the side of this table, we are raising the 2021 guidance on targeting an EPS growth of
about 25% to 27%.
And then what can be explained in that, I think we see really a new decision process with our clients, with a preoccupation
to really move from a product centered economy to an experienced economy, the value of usage, product and services.
Sustainability is at the core. I think when shortage conversation will be reduced in many industries in maybe 2, 3 or 4
quarters from now, I think the topic will be back about really how do we create sustainable portfolio and circular economy.
So we are really working hard on this topic, and I think this is creating visibility for Dassault Systèmes with new value
networks for those industries.
And really, our focus is really deep customer focus with virtual twin experience with the platform itself, the
3DEXPERIENCE platform, and really the capitalization of knowledge and know-how. So we are going to share, of course,
like I'm going to share this agenda with Pascal. So let me just give you the context in which we are playing. I would say
that when this year will be over, we will have well positioned the company in these 3 big sectors of the economy, all
manufactured goods, life science and health care at large, and then infrastructure with energy on cities, which basically, at
the end of those loops are the consumers, the patients, human as patients, and human as citizens and workers.
So this is what we do. This is the core of Dassault Systèmes. And I believe this third quarter, on the showcase we have in
each of them, illustrates that shift from digitalization to true virtualization of things, which is really, there is a big difference.
When you do a digital document, you reduce the time to communicate them, make them available to everyone. When you
do virtualization, you increase the prediction of what is going to happen in the real world. So it's not a light difference. It's a
very big one. I think I will take briefly 3 or 4 examples.
An airplane does not take off by accident. You have to simulate everything. Synthetic control arm, the third group of
patients, which is a virtual court, well, that speaks for itself. You have the placebo group, you have the patients which are
under treatment, and you have a third group now showing up, which is the reveal of AI-based observation of long track
record to really create this. It's happening. It's not just a view of the brain. It's really happening, and it's in action. I will
come back on this.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 28, 2021

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 5So virtual twin experience to design to operate companies. This is where we are going. A good example of it is the
Renault showcase, and there will be many others in the future, where really the transformation of this group is really
centered on a fundamental shift from digitalization to virtualization of everything, the way products are created, produced,
delivered, and even the way the company is working. And my friend, Luca has a 45 second message, so please run the
video.
[Presentation]
Luca de Meo
Renault SA
Renaulution. That's the name we have chosen for our short, mid and long-term strategic plan. One simple slogan, it will be
moving our focus from volume to value. We have 3 phases. First phase is resurrection, running from 2020 to 2023. It will
be clearly about cost reduction, margin and cash generation. Renovation spanning from 2023 to 2025. This is when we
will benefit from a completely new and revamped lineup, electric and electrified. And then third phase is revolution. From
2025 onwards, it's about becoming a player in the data, energy and services.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
I couldn't find a better synthetic precise view of why they are adopting the 3DEXPERIENCE platform, because when
you know fleet's conditions of operation, you can better understand what kind of product or services could be provided.
So it's a great -- I think we were very happy to build up this transformation road map with them on the deployment of
3DEXPERIENCE platform. And you see here very tangible reasons for that, shortening the development of the vehicles,
but also providing new types of services. The cloud platform being adopted for global collaboration and its cloud native,
reaching ultimately, a large percentage of the total population of the group.
So more will come on November 9. We have the 3DEXPERIENCE forum in Western Europe, and we are very pleased to
have the VP of Renault coming to speak about their transformation. And so we will do the PR at that time. That's why it
was not done today, but we just wanted to give you visibility there.
The second remark I want to share with you is the expansion of the scope of the 3DEXPERIENCE platform, going beyond
product creation and production, which is about product in operation, explore the way things are used in real world. And
that's -- a good representation is that you will see everywhere in our solutions going forward is this famous IFWE Loop, we
call it the IFWE Loop, which is to connect the world of producing with creating and producing with the word of using the
solutions. And this is happening in all sectors of the economy and it explains a few moves we have been doing.
But as Luca de Meo said, he wants to use the smart data analytics of vehicle usage to really provide new offer for his
clients, which is exactly a proof point about that trend, and it's happening everywhere. As a side note, we are very
pleased to have taken an equity position in a very innovative start-up called Bloom here in France. What they do is smart
analytics of all information on social network to why do we think it's a value to connect with them. For a simple reason, all
enterprises we serve in the world want to improve their understanding about what their consumers, patients, or citizens
are expecting. There is no better way than observing what is said and written on the social networks of the world. And that
new reach, we believe, will be possible. That's why you have the blue arrow here -- the blue zone here on the IFWE Loop
is to demonstrate that we are connecting the 3DEXPERIENCE platform with humans to understand the value of it.
So whether it's a consumer or a patient or a citizen. And we have already great customers. They have already great
customers. And we are already, as you know, all the names I presented here, and you see them hopefully in the
presentation. All those names are already, for example, CENTRIC PLM clients. So we are already there for the collection
definition. We are already there from the portfolio. Connecting that approach to expectation from consumers is very
critical, and this is happening everywhere.
So we continue to stick to what we said, be game changer in 3 sectors of the economy, how the world is manufacturing
things, objects; how are we transforming life science and health care; and how do we play to improve quality of life with
infrastructure.
Let's have a few illustrations about why there are good reasons to believe that it's happening. The MEDIDATA NEXT
event was an amazing, amazing event, really with 3,000 customers and partners, 200-plus speakers, 55 countries
represented. And when you notice the names on what were the subject matter, like Moderna with next-generationDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 28, 2021

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 6medicine; Amgen, with data everywhere, anywhere, anytime on analytics; and then LabCorp with strategic sensor cloud
partnership, so we can connect with the patient on the new equipment that they will be using; Medicenna, with integrated
data science for agile therapeutic development. By the way, this is where we have synthetic control arm applications.
Boston Scientific, a prestigious other name, large-scale remote monitoring for operational excellence and compliance.
Even the FDA itself, discovering how much synthetic control arm can bring to the evaluation of value and risk, which is
always the real challenge in this world where there is so much complexity.
So a great event, a great dynamic, and above all proof points from customers that we are bringing real value to them. Few
quick examples here. Rho, they are doing decentralized clinical trial. They have been adopting Medidata patient cloud for
that. It's a wonderful solution, extremely powerful solution for that. It's the best on the market, and they are expecting to
really improve their competitive advantage, of course, to accelerate the clinical development program and to provide --
we provide the sponsor a complete holistic view to the operational data that they use in the clinical trial. And of course, it
improves their decision-making process.
So this is in America. If I look at Asia and specifically China, and the reason why I say China is, look at this, there are
new players coming really in the manufacturing of extremely sophisticated machines, high-tech machines for genome
sequencing, and they are adopting license to cure from medical device, which is really all the process to create, produce
and certify the compliancy with, of course, all the regulatory rules, and they want to accelerate the -- first of all, it's a new
possibility for them to reach a level of excellence never reached before. So that's another example that we selected for
you just with proof points.
BMW. They are all talking these days about shortage. But part of the shortage is also the restructuring of the supply chain
at large. And why the supply chain is going to be restructured massively everywhere around the world, in my mind, it's not
the reason of shortage only, it's because of sustainability reasons. And this resetting of the world of industry is going to
happen and the ones who are going to do it first will have a strategic advantage. With BMW, we are deploying DELMIA
Quintiq for production planning, scheduling. And of course, when you speak about production planning and scheduling,
you speak about all the constraints for the flow of things that should come together at the right time, so you can deliver the
product and the cars you need to deliver.
On the third example, also to show that we are focusing not only in production quality, but global ballet, if you want, about
everything that happens to make sure that companies can deliver on time and with the precision, is Hexcel, aerospace
supplier, where they are basically taking the same approach with DELMIA Quintiq.
Mainstream market. We have now multiple energy sources for the -- you all associate our mainstream market to
SOLIDWORKS. But we believe that the mainstream market is also driven by CENTRIC PLM. And the footprint that those
companies are opening up are just gigantic. We reached with CENTRIC PLM, 500 companies, amazing logos. Over 2,000
brands are trusting now CENTRIC PLM. And with all on the cloud subscription model, clearly, it's about the life cycle of
collection, the supply management. And we are going beyond with what is called VIP, which is the trading between the
stores and the one producing the collection to really commit for sales.
So we are reaching a point where this platform is becoming a platform that connects the dots in a holistic manner between
collection creation, store activities and profiling of offers that are going to be part of that multichannel approach. We don't
forget our existing loyal long-term customers, Airbus. We are even doing very open and very innovative things. As you
know, there are many, many fronts of development with Airbus. We have talked about it before. But this is kind of a new
unique expansion of our partnership, because we are really investing together to create a virtual twin of earth to really use
the way they collect data and improve services online that will be used in the world of nutrition supply, food supply, as well
as the surveillance of territory deforestation, land planning, climate change, et cetera.
So why do I like this example? For the simple reason, it shows that we can reach scale.
Interstellar Lab. Let's go beyond the current planet. This is an amazing Franco-American company, building modules
for sustainable living on earth and in space. I'm sure that our friends from Blue Origin, who are our clients, will see; and
from [indiscernible] and many other launchers will see the value of that, where basically micro production unit will be over
time turning around us and around the planet. This is what they do. And it's going to be used, of course, for BioPod, for
example. So I don't think it's anecdote. I think this is showing an interesting expansion of our planet in terms of making
things available for human.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 28, 2021

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7And finally, I cannot forget the COP26 challenges. The Paris Agreement was a very successful one, where many
companies committed. But the question now is about how to improve the commitment and how to make it happen. In
the Financial Times survey, 36% of the executives are really considering how to start integrating sustainability and SBTi
basically in their product development and operation. And innovation will be probably a massive element that will trigger
those transformations.
I think we can connect to great showcases we have today. If you look at what we are doing with Bouygues and with new
virtualization of construction process, so removing waste massively. And there is a lot of waste in construction. And also,
we have here another use of platform with a German company. We have many examples here, which are good illustration
even for wine, by the way, which shows that the platform can be used not only for planes and cars or medicine, but can be
used to better manage the logistics on the packaging for this company.
Last but not least, before I conclude and give the floor to Pascal. If you have the opportunity to be in London, please go
and stop by at the Design Museum. We had a big event last week with the best designer of the planet, discussing about
how the new way of design could radically change product sustainability. And if you look at the right side of this illustration,
you have in this museum for a certain period, I think until year-end, an illustration about those tubes that you see below
the car here are exactly the materials on the volume materials, I should have put the scale, but roughly speaking, it's
about 60, 70 centimeters high, less than a meter of materials that are making those cars.
What is intriguing when you see it that way is you say, wow, if we do it right at the design stage, we can do circularity.
Something new is going to happen there. We all agree, the top designer of the world and us, we all agreed that this is
a sweet spot for the future, and we are going to make it happen. You can click on the link. I've put several links in the
presentation, because I think it's useful to come back to this. In short, I think we are walking the talk with the commitment
as on date for the Dassault Systèmes, the purpose, which is harmonized product nature and life. And with that Pascal,
you have the floor to illustrate that numbers are resonating.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Thank you, Bernard. Very inspiring, by the way, speech, talks. Hi to everyone, and I hope all of you, you are doing
extremely well, and thank you for joining us today.
So turning to our financial performance. I think we delivered strong third quarter results, thanks to the broad-based growth
across regions, product line and industries. Now starting with the top line year-over-year comparisons. Total revenue
grew organically 12% to EUR 1.116 billion, near to the top of our 10% to 13% range. Software revenue grew 11%, driven
by the license and other revenue, which rose 24% to EUR 108.3 million, which is well above the guidance. Subscription
and support revenue increased 8%, driven by the high double-digit growth in subscriptions, reflecting not only the strong
MEDIDATA momentum, but also the 3DEXPERIENCE sales.
Recurring revenue represents today 80% of the total software revenue. Services revenue was up 19%, driven by the large
3DEXPERIENCE platform project we have. And we think we achieved a very interesting services gross margin of 20%,
substantially better than compared to last year, thanks to the effort we made in 2020 to preserve the margin in the face of
the pandemic, at the same time to also secure our commitment for our customers.
Operating margin expanded to 33.8%. And finally, EPS grew 40% to EUR 0.22.
Now let's turn to the software revenue by geography. The Americas grew 12% during the third quarter, benefiting from
a strong performance in life sciences and health care, but also aerospace and consumer packaged goods. On a year-
to-date basis, the Americas represent 38% of the total software revenue. Europe increased 9%, led by the Northern
Europe as well as France. And Germany rebound significantly during the quarter. And on a year-to-year basis, Europe
represented 36% of the revenue. Asia rose 13% with India and Japan rebounding during the quarter. China grew 8% on
the back of a strong year-over-year comparison. The year-to-date for China is exceeding 25%. And year-to-date Asia
represents 26% of the revenue.
Now let's zoom on the product line performance. Industrial Innovation software revenue rose 8% to EUR 555.3 million
driven by an extremely good performance of SIMULIA and DELMIA, as well as the large customer wins we signed during
the quarter. CATIA license revenue was up also double digit, while ENOVIA experienced strong subscription growth,
which is something I want to spend 1 minute on this. More and more, we see the subscription model becoming the
standard for ENOVIA and the 3DEXPERIENCE platform, which is also understandable because they are the corroborativeDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 28, 2021
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8piece of our solutions. And that's not yet the case for, I would say, the CATIA and to a certain extent, SOLIDWORKS,
which are still driven by the license model.
Now let's move to life sciences software. Revenue totaled EUR 226.5 million, an increase of 19%. MEDIDATA continued
to experience a strong momentum across its product portfolio including MEDIDATA Rave, MEDIDATA Acorn AI, and
MEDIDATA Patient Cloud, as well as across end markets, including pharmaceutical and biological companies, the
contract research organizations, but also the medical devices company, where we signed a new enterprise platform deal
with a top 10 med device company. We also saw a high double-digit growth in the FX rate, and if you remember, it was
one of the questions you had at the beginning. Rave is basically the de facto standard in this industry. But what about
all the new modules developed on top of, and we are very pleased with the performance we have been able to achieve
since the beginning of the year. In summary, the life science industry is transforming rapidly, adopting decentralized trials
and AI-based analytics using MEDIDATA unique data science capabilities and has evidence at the next conference this
month.
In the mainstream innovation, software revenue rose 13% to EUR 262.9 million. And I would qualify this growth being
broad-based, drove by SOLIDWORKS software revenue growth of 12% on the back on a relatively stronger comparison.
If you remember, last year, it was higher than 10% as the recovery started in Q3 last year. We continue to see a good
adoption of our 3DEXPERIENCE WORKS family, the cloud-based solutions starting during this period. And as Bernard
mentioned, CENTRIC PLM executed extremely well again this quarter, reaching the milestone of 500 clients and driving a
high double-digit increase in revenue, could be triple digit, very close.
Now let's review our key growth strategies, specifically the 3DEXPERIENCE and the cloud adoptions and how we are
progressing relatively to the objective we laid out during the 2020 Capital Markets Day. Year-to-date 3DEXPERIENCE
sales grew 18%, with license and other software revenue up 36% to account for 28% of the total software revenue, an
increase of 3 points compared to last year. The strong value proposition of our 3DEXPERIENCE platform has been a key
factor in driving the client wins.
The cloud revenue increased 24% in the quarter and now representing 20% of the revenue, which is plus 1 point
compared to last year and is driven obviously by the strength in life sciences as well as the 3DEXPERIENCE cloud
solutions. We are focused on supporting our customers as they adopt the new business model. They are coming to
us in order to accelerate innovation cycles, speed up execution, drive the business transformations, all centered on
improving value and experience for users and customers. Our strategy is also to enable this transformation through the
native cloud applications and extensions to existing on-premise investment and the 3DEXPERIENCE platform with an
open ecosystem. And I think the Renault partnership is a new illustration of this momentum. Not only, as you say, in the
mainstream market, but also for the large corporations, which has been, to a certain extent, the most difficult people to
convince to adopt the cloud solution. But we are moving along this way.
Now let's say a few words about profitability. We delivered significant outperformance in operating margin this quarter.
The operating margin expanded by 560 basis points to 33.8% versus the midpoint of our guidance of 29.15%. And it's
an overperformance of 465 basis points. This was driven by the revenue at the high end of the guidance, point number
one. Then the strong operational execution as well and the continuation of the pandemic-related expense, and last but not
least, the headcount tailwind we discussed last quarter.
Let's say a few words about the headcount. This quarter, we saw strong hiring activities, up more than 2x more compared
to Q1. So I think we did great in the way to continue to attract the talent and to onboard them. And this is resulting in a
2% overall headcount increase driven specifically by the research and development up to 4%. I think we have a track
record of delivering transformation innovation in the context of the mission-driven culture. However, the attrition remained
elevated, and we are nevertheless confident that we have the ability to continue to attract and retain the top talent. This is
a top priority for Q4 and for the beginning of next year.
EPS, this is reflected -- I mean the good performance in the operating margin is obviously reflecting the EPS with a growth
of 40% to EUR 0.22 compared to our guidance of 15% to 22%. This represents a EUR 0.03 above the midrange of the
guidance. EUR 0.025 is coming from the profitability and the good performance and EUR 0.005 is coming from foreign
exchanges.
Now turning back to our financial performance and balance sheet items. Let's say a few words about the cash flow. Year-
to-date cash flow from operations rose 24.5% relative to last year to EUR 1.255 billion, which is almost what we delivered
last year for the full year. So we are almost a quarter in advance. Our net financial debt position at the end of SeptemberDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 28, 2021
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9decreased by EUR 850 million, to be at EUR 1.2 billion and putting us on the pace to reach our deleveraging goals well
ahead of the schedules. It's almost a year before. So I think we have been able to manage extremely well the cash flow
during the last 18 months. And as you know, this is giving some new room to maneuver in the coming years.
Now let's say a few words about the 2021 financial objectives. We raised our fiscal year 2021 revenue growth objective
range from EUR 4.745 billion to EUR 4.790 billion to EUR 4.8 billion to EUR 4.825 billion, which is representing an
increase of 10% to 11%. We expect our operating margin in a range of 34% to 34.1% versus 32.7% to 33.1% previously.
And we expect to expand the headcount tailwind. We expanded this year to dissipate in the coming quarter. We stated
to resume the travel, increase the sales and marketing spend and accelerate also the net gain in hiring in the key areas
across the globe.
Consequently, we are raising our EPS objective range to EUR 0.99 to EUR 0.91 to EUR 0.94 to EUR 0.95, which
represents a growth of 25% to 27%. All the updated guidance captured in the incremental earnings aside from the third
quarter and increased revenue visibility while expense remaining changed are captured in the guidance. So you will find
more detail about the full year objectives as well as the fourth quarter guidance in the earnings press release and the
presentations. I think it's time to conclude now, Bernard.
A few takeaways I want to remind to you. One, I think we are encouraged to see the vast majority of our end markets
growing double digits. Bernard said a few words in the introduction, but I think this is a very key takeaway and especially
in the manufacturing core industries. It was also great to see that certain countries like India, hit by the pandemic, staged
a comeback this quarter.
The second thing which I think the client is imperative of the virtual twin experience is the inclusiveness by the way of
platformization and the cloud as well as the sustainability accelerating, and we view these as secular drivers. So it's not
something for 1 or 2 quarters. I think it's for the next decade. Our strategy, I think, is well enabled, these imperatives and
our 3DEXPERIENCE platform powering the virtual twin experience is a competitive advantage as it connects IDs, people
and data with a common architecture.
Our commitment to drive our strategy is clear, and we thank them for their continued trust this quarter. Lastly, we hope
to resume in-person meetings with the investment community in the coming months. I know I was speaking with some of
you. You start to be back to the office, and I will maybe have a chance to see you in person. So I look forward to see you
soon. I think Bernard and I now are ready to take your questions.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We have the first question from the line of Adam Wood from Morgan Stanley.
Adam Dennis Wood
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
First of all, congratulations on another strong quarter. I've got two questions, please. The first one was around the hiring
attrition and therefore margins; probably a bit more for Pascal. Could you just talk a little bit about whether you believe
you can continue to hire at the pace that you saw in Q3 or even accelerate it? And then a little bit around what the attrition
means in terms of wage inflation for next year. And kind of linked to that, do you start to have any concerns about the
ability to deliver the growth that you want given the difficulties of getting the headcount up as we look into the next couple
of years? That's really on the margin side.
And then secondly, I wanted to ask kind of a bigger picture question around China. I mean, it's obviously been nice
growth driver this year. It's a huge opportunity for you. I guess European companies have found a nice happy medium
between the U.S. and domestic players, and I think we hear in other sectors of software that a lot of U.S. companies
have almost exited China. Could you just talk a little bit about the competitive landscape there in terms of the traditional
companies that you would compete with in the industry and whether that situation is benefiting you? And maybe also from
a domestic competition point of view, do you see any emerging players who, over time, could become more competitive
and obviously, privileged by the government in terms of companies being encouraged to use their solutions rather than
external ones?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Adam. Pascal, I think you...
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Okay. I will take the first one. So yes, you are right, Adam. Let me give you again some perspective. In Q1, we were flat
in terms of number of people. In Q2, we hired a little bit more than 50 net. Now it's 300 for this quarter, and I do expect for
Q4 to hire close to 200 net people. That gives you to a certain extent the trend.
For next year, I do expect to hire 1,000 people per quarter in average. And I hope we'll be able to contain the attrition.
Why so? Because the normal attrition we have per quarter is around 400 people. 500 sometimes. The peak is usually in
Q3, by the way, it's between 600 and 700 depending on the year. But there is something new happening, which is, in the
1,000 people we are planning to hire, we could now count that 100 of them, they will not show up.
So the first day, you are expecting them to come and they are not coming. It's something new. We did not factor this in
our plan in 2021, but now I'm really taking this into account. And I'm working on this. The vast majority were in India. And
I think we took some decisions in order to adjust the composition. I think we were slightly below the peers. And I hope in
Q4, we will be able to correct this. But there is a piece, which is a new behavior. We just have to take this into account.
So coming back to your question for next year. So if you combine the fact that I really want to improve significantly
the number of people in addition, in net, plus the fact that we really want to have the people being on the road, visiting
customers, we want also to relaunch the marketing machine at the level where it should be. So I think the question is
really to give you some guidance for next year for the EBIT margin. You should count that between 1 point to 1.5 points
less compared to this year as a good indication of where the margin should be. It's a little bit early. Again, we are still in
the middle of the budget discussion. So I hope you will not blame me if I'm coming with some adjustment early next year.
But with this, I think you have a good way to modelize and understand where we are going.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11Related to the second question, which is quite important, China landscape and the dynamic. We are welcome in China
first. We have a trusted stable relationship with prestigious companies and also their partner network. The dynamic
for cloud, for example, is very good in China, unlike many other foreign companies. And the second thing is I think it's
understood by many Chinese executives that our solutions are core to help them be more sustainable. That sustainability,
even though we can discuss about the global emission factors, is really on the agenda. It's a very strong preoccupation.
We see it in energy, of course, with nuclear project; we see it in hydro project, and we see it in infrastructure; in medical,
I mentioned a few customer selection there; in mobility, and we are well recognized. So to your specific question, Adam,
about competitive landscape, we are very well recognized, and we have a lot of synergy with existing companies there. At
this point in time, our real challenge is to continue to develop our partner network to fulfill the demand.
Operator
The next question from Frederic Boulan from BofA.
Frederic Emile Alfred Boulan
BofA Securities, Research Division
A couple of questions on my side. First of all, you mentioned supply chain. Interested to see how you see the supply
chain issues impacting, in particular, auto, airspace and other manufacturing, both in terms of long-term demand for
your structural solutions, but also more short term, considering some of the constraints we're seeing in the supply chain.
Secondly, on life science, very strong growth again from MEDIDATA, 20% growth in Q3. How do you see the medium-
term potential of this business? It seems to be faring very nicely versus the 13% to 15% long-term outlook you have for life
science. And then thirdly, on the industry consolidation piece, I don't know if you have any thoughts on AspenTech deal,
whether you would expect further consolidation in the industry and whether you see incremental risk from an integrator
vendor model versus a pure software model like yourselves?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Thank you. Supply chain. That's a very important question. There are 2 dimensions to it; the tactical issues right now
are that some industries are suffering from shortage of electronic components or more and there is a long term. My
observation today is that in the years to come, in almost all industries, there will be a new fundamental setup of the supply
chain for the following reason: The use of material science is going to evolve, primary materials and the way they are
transformed. And we see it now in prototyping activities, but it's going to change.
The second thing is the impact of the logistics on the science-based reporting for sustainability is going to be more
seriously evaluated. And there is a third thing, it's the very nature of the product structure. Like when you think about
gasoline engine on a car versus electrical car, battery-based cars, it's a massive change in terms of who is doing what. Do
you want to delegate the battery? Or do you want to have it part of the OEM activity? Do you want to master the sense?
Or do you delegate? Do you want to delegate production or not? Those 3 factors: Science, logistic and the new nature of
offers, product portfolio and service, this is a long-term impact on the entire setting of the industry worldwide.
And for us, we are in the center of that game, because we can connect science with evaluation of flows around the world
with, of course, the very nature of new portfolios that are being created by those companies, and it's going to happen
everywhere. So we'll come back on this topic. My point on what I mentioned this morning at one of the interview is the
current tactical issues, it's a small part of the resetting of the entire industry supply chain going forward. And it's a very
small part because at the end, it's about who creates which value, where, for what kind of delivery to the consumer. So
the entire industry is going to go to a logic which is similar to what is happening in retail. But instead of happening to retail,
it's the entire industry itself and the way you deliver product and service, what we call experiences.
As a matter of fact, to get understanding about what Dassault Systèmes is doing, which for me is an excitement every
day, is we are building -- my view of the future is manufacturing industries will produce experiences, not products.
And then clients will deliver experience as a service to their clients, whether they are consumers, patient or citizen.
Experience as a service is going to come. It's not an IT issue. It's the use of product and services in the context of what I
call experience economy. And this is happening in retail. It's visible people get it, but it's going to happen for all industries
we serve. That's why we are very different in terms of investment than any other of the competitors we have. I could go
further, but we'll have opportunity to discuss that later.
Pascal DalozDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 28, 2021
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12COO, CFO & Director
You want me to answer the second question?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Yes, please do.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
On life sciences? Yes, you could always expect us to change the long-term plan, but there is something you know now
from us is when we have a long-term plan, we stick to the plan. So I told you at the time of the acquisition that the long-
term plan was between 13% to 15% of the revenue growth. And at the same time, we will also improve by 200 basis
points the EBIT margin. We are committing to this plan. We are, to a certain extent, over delivering this year, but the
comp base will probably be less favorable for next year. And also, I want you to take into consideration something. The
performance of Life Sciences for us will not come only from MEDIDATA. It will come from the other pieces we have, right?
BIOVIA is obviously one of them, on research and discovery. But more and more, we see more traction on the
manufacturing side, on the supply chain management side, on the product introduction side, and this is where we are also
putting the focus in order to accelerate this piece of the software -- this piece of the growth, if you want the exposure of the
solution to this market. So considering that the life science sector will continue to deliver 13%, 15% growth overall for a
few years, I think it's not so bad.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Related to the consolidation to follow exactly Pascal's point, there is so much old software in the world. I don't want to buy
old software. I want to buy expertise on science. But we don't -- the unique thing about the Dassault Systèmes portfolio
those days, it's highly modern software. I mean we have a platform which is cloud native. It's powering all our software we
do, and this is across the product line. And many acquisitions are going to be based on acquiring old software where the
game is changing for those industries which are using. Of course, it's slow, but it's going to happen. And for example, let's
be clear, we will be a big player in continuous process for manufacturing, not only discrete. And we believe we can do it
with new generation of software like bioreactor in the pharma sector, where, of course, there were other players that have
been there for years, but with software which are not architected for the future.
So we put a lot of attention on the right architecture, the science in, and the fact that we always go to the next shot
because there is a parameter that needs to be taken into account, which is it takes time for clients to transform
themselves. And we have to be there at the right time. So consolidation, yes, with the same law on the scope of what
Pascal said, with smart targeting, targeting the next shot. I don't want to have to be buying an old company and trying
to optimize and reduce cost on things on there. I think this is not fun. That's not what we like. We leave that to certain
investors who think they can clean up the house, but it's not my job. We don't want that.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
And the last question, which was related to maybe, let me rephrase what I understood, is the balance between integration
and software. I think to answer to these questions, you are missing one specific point, which is the platform game. I think
platform is changing in the split. The split between system integration of software has been the one before the platform.
Why so? Because the platform is by definition the way to integrate the different pieces together. It's the way to deliver the
end-to-end experiences, to connect the different stakeholders. So does that mean the services piece will disappear? It
means the nature of the services will be different.
It will be probably much more outcome-based, much more related to the company transformation, because you need to
evolve, to change the organization, to redefine the roles, to trade and prepare the people and the workforce of the future.
So that's really how we see the trends going on.
And related to the cloud, because this is maybe also the questions behind. I think the applications are defining what
kind of architecture and infrastructure you need under these, not the opposite way. Otherwise, you compromise theDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 28, 2021

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 13experiences, you compromise the user experience, you compromise the quality of the services. And we have enough
proof point to tell you that the decision we took a few years ago to have our own cloud architecture and infrastructure is
becoming a significant competitive advantage, because we can basically master the entire stack without having to spend
our life to develop IT systems to be interoperable with all the many legacy systems they have. That's really, again, the
platform game is changing these borders and the strategic definition of what are the software, by the way. And Bernard
has an interesting comment, which says, "I do not want to do a software as a service. I want to do experience as a
service", which is much more deep if you understand what is behind.
Operator
We have the next question from the line of James Goodman from Barclays.
James Arthur Goodman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Maybe following up a little bit on the platform comments. I mean, the adoption of 3DEXPERIENCE this quarter stepped
up significantly. So just wondered from a product perspective, maybe you could add a little bit more color there? I think
you mentioned ENOVIA on the subscription side being strong, but presumably that's only a sort of smaller part of that.
And then just secondly, I mean, considering the very strong MEDIDATA performance that you spoke to just now, I think,
recurring, ex MEDIDATA, perhaps just a little bit light, therefore, I wondered if you could just help us with any detail there
across subscription or maintenance on the non-MEDIDATA recurring performance in the quarter?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Just one remark before Pascal provides insight about your questions. As you notice, everything we do now is platform
based; MEDIDATA is a data science platform, of course, with AI and all those technology. 3DEXPERIENCE is a platform,
powering everything, including the mainstream SOLIDWORKS. And CENTRIC PLM itself is a platform. And they are all
extremely well positioned to complement each other and provide this future to what we call platform parametrization, so
we can adapt. And I'll give you a concrete example because it was used last quarter. The Bouygues example where we
have stopped an agreement with a big IT company doing too much customization and decided to do native parametrize,
which is working extremely well, and the adoption by users is extremely well.
So we are demonstrating that the platform power is really suitable for a new sector of conquest, like construction and
what we did for lean in manufacturing is applying to lean for construction with just parameterization, for example, and
the collaborative process is working the same way. So basically, the mainstream platforms, the industry platform and the
health platform are all acting in accordance to connect the dots. With that, Pascal?
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Yes. On the numbers related to the 3DEXPERIENCE platform, the plan is 2/3 of the software revenue will come to the
3DEXPERIENCE platform-related software in 2025. And obviously, this is calculated outside the recent acquisition we
did, CENTRIC PLM. And as Bernard said, MEDIDATA is already a platform. To achieve this number, we need to continue
to deliver the growth we have with the 3DEXPERIENCE Platform Solutions. But the key point is really to accelerate
the adoption of the SOLIDWORKS 3DEXPERIENCE platform, which is on the way. I mean, the solution is there. The
VAR are enabled. We have adjusted the compensation model for the VAR, putting more on phases on the fact that the
3DEXPERIENCE platform is becoming a must for them. So I'm pretty confident that we are on the right path to make it
happen.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
And noticeable, Pascal, in China, the adoption is faster than anywhere is of the 3DEXPERIENCE platform with
SOLIDWORKS.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 14Coming back to the second part of your question related to the recurring part of the revenue. Yes, you're right. I mean
the subscriptions grew extremely well this quarter, but it was not only coming from MEDIDATA. It was also coming from
the rest of the software, specifically ENOVIA and 3DEXPERIENCE platform, but also SIMULIA. And also DELMIA, we
have more and more subscriptions also on DELMIA. So which basically comes to the second part of your questions, what
about the maintenance and support performance. I think it's the lowest point we have touched. Why so? Because if you
remember, I mean, there is a strong correlation between the growth and the new license you saw the previous year. And
as you may know, last year, we were decreasing in terms of new licenses. So that's the reason why the growth has not
been at the level it used to be historically. However, if you remember, in Q4 last year, we were back on growth with the
license. So clearly, this is the lowest point. We achieved a 3% growth for the maintenance and support this quarter. And I
do expect rapidly to come back to where it should be, between 4% to 5%.
Operator
The next question from Jeff Jones from UBS.
Michael Briest
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
It's Michael Briest. Just 2 for me. Just, I guess, following on from that Pascal. If I look at deferred income or whatever it's
called now, unearned revenues. I mean, the growth in Q1 was 19% and then 17% and then 11% this quarter. What does
that say about the -- maybe the billing profile of the cloud business is different from support and maintenance, but also
the growth of recurring revenue in Q4 when you've got a much tougher comp on deferred revenue and into 2022. And
then on the issue of sort of talent recruitment and retention. I think it's quite a wide issue in the sector. You announced a
couple of weeks ago a new employee shareholding scheme of about 5 million shares. Is that something that's going to be
expanded? Is it going to be an annual program? And equally on the stock-based compensation, it's about 200 million this
year, as it was last year. Is that a new run rate? Or were there any one-offs in there around MEDIDATA?
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Okay. So I'm going to take the first question. No, I would say the unearned revenue is -- you cannot use this as an early
indicator. I think it's a mix between the maintenance and support of the MEDIDATA, and it's heavily dependent on the
contractual framework. And we have big differences compared to one customer to another one. So I will not use this as a
way to have an early indicator, if you want, of what should be the maintenance and support performance. The best way
is really to do what I was suggesting to you, you take the new licenses we sold a year before, you compute the numbers,
and you will land to exactly what I'm saying. That's really the way we modelize it, the way we plan it. And to a certain
extent, it's a good news because you could expect next year to have more contribution from maintenance and support.
Bernard, you want to answer to the second part of the question, which is the employee plan we did?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Well, first, it's well received. It's part of -- we made it consistent with previous years shareholder program. So it will stay
consistent in terms of -- from a pure dilution standpoint, if I may say so, we are not going to do anything that goes on
top of something, it's going to be part of the total envelope. So it's a very, very clean, clear process, and I think it's well
received by people.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Just to give a complement, Michael, you are right. I mean, we took these decisions to have the ability to address all the
employees of Dassault Systèmes.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Yes, because, of course, the LTI is only a subset.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & DirectorDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 28, 2021
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15Exactly. And this is becoming critical in terms of retention, and you are right to notice it. And that's the reason why we
want this to be reground mechanisms. But as Bernard said, it's already in the envelope because we're going to make a
trade-off between the LTI, the long-term incentive plan, which is specific, which is a dedicated set of actions for population
and the one to speak of, which is touching all the employees.
Michael Briest
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Okay. So it's not on top of the 200 million for this year?
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
No.
Operator
The next question is from Stacy Pollard from JPMorgan.
Stacy Elizabeth Pollard
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
A few extras for me. Can you remind us how you're progressing with sort of CATIA, ENOVIA, DELMIA within the EV arms
of the large OEMs. Are most of these decisions made within the EV area? Are there more still in process? And what has
been your win rate? And then second question, you mentioned customers like Renault leveraging smart data usage. I
know Dassault has some offerings here, but is this an area that you might also consider further investment or M&A?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Stacy, clearly, I would say that our platform is the work standard for all EV programs, no matter where they are. As you
may remember, all the early players are -- almost all of them are using the 3DEXPERIENCE platform. So it has been a
very strong factor of confidence for an existing player in that sector to say, "no doubt, that's a platform we need to use for
our own internal program." So yes, the dynamic is very positive there. Of course, with different constraints like integrating
with existing environment and so on, but we are in a very good position. And the adoption is good. It explains also why, as
Pascal mentioned, we are double-digit growth in those sectors. We are already installed with powerful V5 product portfolio
and expanding with the platform. So the last point I would mention on that is that the system approach is becoming very
important. The challenge with EV that was not really solved before is the energy bill of the vehicle.
And not only the energy bill when you get a new brand vehicle, but how does it last? What is the energy bill of the vehicle
after 3 years of usage? And everyone will have to provide new law on those because if you have a manufacturer selling
an EV with a certain characteristic and 3 years later, you get only half of the characteristic of the vehicle, it's going to be
a big issue. People smile about it, but it's a serious topic. It's a very serious topic, and I think the regulator is going to put
some rules there, not to speak about circularity about how you recycle, where we are already in that aspect. So everything
related to electrification, we are in a very strong position. Related to the consequences on smart data and so on, Stacy,
you are on a very good point. We want to help our customers deliver experience as a service.
We presented months ago the case for smart data analytics for civil aircraft fleet, health and analysis with big data with a
great client, Gulfstream. They improved massively the availability of the fleet of aircraft, predictive maintenance included.
This is the way to go. It's to provide the experience as a service to the clients they have. So big data and smart data is as
illustrated with many data, as illustrated in manufacturing world, as illustrated with what we do, we force our customers
for what we call operational availability of equipment. It's a core science for Dassault Systèmes. And we think we are very
well positioned, and the platform will reveal that those who are using disconnected systems are not going to make it work
properly.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Just to complement because Stacy's question was is it an area for potential M&A, we did Bloom. So I think towards the
next time, you have the answer.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 28, 2021

Next question is from Mohammed Moawalla from Goldman Sachs.
Mohammed Essaji Moawalla
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
I had a couple of questions. So firstly, around kind of your visibility on the top line. I mean we've obviously seen cyclical
and kind of pent-up demand recovery. But as we kind of bridge to more of the sort of structural drivers, I'm curious, if you
could kind of comment on visibility into sort of next year, particularly around the top line. You've obviously been signing a
number of both kind of mid-size but larger deals. So could you talk us through that visibility you have where perhaps it's
the strongest and where the potential areas of risk are?
And my second question is, as Pascal, you mentioned you've delevered quite quickly. How should we think of -- I know
you've said that you don't want to run with sort of excessive cash on the balance sheet. Are you kind of looking to
potentially evaluate more transformational deals? Or we should look at more kind of bolt-ons. And are there any particular
areas that perhaps are a matter of priority right now for you? I know you've talked about sort of simulation where you need
to kind of still build out. But curious to get your thoughts on how you think of M&A.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Mo. I think for the top line, Pascal has the [indiscernible]. So Pascal?
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
No. Again, it's a little bit early to give the perspective for next year. However, the fact that the growth is really coming from
all the different sectors of the economy we are serving, I think it's a good sign. I would have a different feeling if it would
have been dependent only on China or one specific set of industries like life sciences. That's not the case at all. So we
have some good news. For example, Renault is one of them. We are almost tripling the revenue we do with them on
a yearly basis. So I will say some of the large deals we signed recently are giving confidence. However, the size of the
company is also increasing at the same time. So at least we need to nurture this growth. So if you don't mind, Mo, I will
say more at the time of the full year announcement, and I'll give you the perspective. But I'm relatively confident.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Related to what's a very smart question, potential transformational deals and priorities. Of course, it's on the agenda. I
think we will follow the discipline we had, which is really to target the right technology, science and people, and making
sure it makes sense, provided really the ambition we have set up with Pascal that was really revealed on February 6 of
2020, where we said about those 3 sectors of the economy and now we are reframing the priorities of the company from
that standpoint. And I think we are proving it with MEDIDATA and others. It's difficult for me at this point in time to be more
specific, but you understand that with the platform aspect of things.
The data science is, of course, core for all touch points we have. Also being able to help our customers go and deliver
with our platform experience as a service to their own customer is an exciting thing. I think in February, we will talk about
the followup to what we announced, which is IT, because I think you will be quite interested to see how much we are
discovering the potential there. So same with CENTRIC PLM. But I think we have February for that, and I think we will
have the June time frame to really cover with the Capital Markets Day to really go deeper in those priorities.
Mohammed Essaji Moawalla
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
Okay. That's great. If I could squeeze one more in. I mean, do you think the Renault deal and adoption of kind of cloud
native applications; does this mark an inflection point in your view? Or do you think that the customers are still going
to take a much more sort of gradual approach? Or are there any particular industries that perhaps you see more of an
inflection in?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 17First, it's becoming visible for many observers that the speed at which it can be deployed is just very impressive, a game
changer, transformational. We have really a clear commitment from other very large companies to go in that direction.
So too early to say when, but really the clarity for them about going in that direction is there. If you remember more for
Bouygues, which is going -- we see the number of users expanding every week. It's native cloud also. 3DEXPERIENCE
is native cloud. One of the key factors is, of course, the cyber aspect of it. But we have a quite interesting architecture.
We are seriously demonstrating that we can do edge cloud for certain mission-critical environments, with the same
architecture. More to be discussed at another opportunity. It's an exciting moment to leverage private, public, dedicated
cloud in a smart way. And as you know, we manage the stack totally. We know exactly to the chip level what we do, which
we think is an important aspect for the type of customers we have.
Operator
The last question is from Nicolas David from ODDO BHF.
Nicolas David
ODDO BHF Corporate & Markets, Research Division
I have 2 questions, actually, which are follow-ups of already asked question, but more details, I think. First on hiring,
again, I mean, Pascal, you mentioned there's an impact on the bottom line. But if we look at the top line potential impact,
would this put us a risk as we go into 2022, if you can't fill the sales position which are open currently? And any comments
regarding the situation with your sales team attrition and the ability to hire would be helpful there.
And my second question is regarding maintenance again. I mean you mentioned this 4% to 5% growth you are targeting
rapidly. Could you talk about -- were you thinking about Q4 already? Or is it rather '22 things? And also this 4% to 5%
growth, is it the midterm growth you see for this revenue stream in the context of more subscription adoption? Or do you
think that you can go back to faster growth like you used to deliver in maintenance?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Okay. So let's start with the first question related to the hiring. To a certain extent, the situation is not the same across all
the different countries. Where we have, I would say, the more most open positions on the sales side is in United States,
right? And to a certain extent, I do not feel at risk. Why so? Because we have long-standing relationship with many of our
customers. So I will be, to some extent, much more concerned if our resellers, they will have a lack of capacity, because
they have difficulty to hire and retain people, which is not the case. So this is an important point to notice.
Now if we are not capable to fill back this position over the time, this could become an issue, because again, each time we
hire people, we are also changing the profile of the team by infusing also sometimes different generations, different set of
skills. So that's my answer. I do not feel at risk for 2022. And again, we do not have the same problem with the resellers.
The second question, which is an interesting one. First of all, I told you the Q3 is really the lowest point. So I do expect,
obviously, Q4 to go back to the indication I gave to you. So that's point number one. Point number two, to answer to
your questions, it's related to how the mix between subscription and license will evolve, which is probably something
which is still a little bit difficult to predict. I could have a wish, I could have, to a certain extent, a strategy to accelerate the
subscriptions. But as I was telling you, we discovered that some products are much more suitable to the subscription. And
again, people are always putting in the position subscription and license. And I consider you need both. You need both
depending on your business model, depending also on, for example, we have some customers in the defense part. They
do not want to be dependent on anything. They want to control their own destiny for obvious reasons.
So the best way for them is to license the software, and I'm sure we will continue to do it over time. So let's assume that
we are in the previous mix. I'm pretty confident that the maintenance and support will go back to where it used to be in
terms of growth. But we should probably take into consideration that the subscription is growing, I would say, 15% on
average. You are not taking too much risk by doing so. And you will see there is some readjustment. But at the end, it
would not change the overall plan, which is again, the plan we have built is to deliver a 9% growth organic software, and
it's a combination of the license and the recurring part. And that's what I'm speaking. The moving part inside is basically
what I'm playing with it in order to maximize the chance to deliver the plan I committed to do.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Dassault Systèmes 2021 Q4 and Full Year
Earnings Presentation. [Operator Instructions] After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer
session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, François Bordonado. Please go ahead, sir.
François-José Bordonado
Vice-President of Investor Relations
Thank you, Roberto. Good morning, everyone. This is Francois Bordonado speaking, Dassault Systemes Investor
Relations. From the company, we have Bernard Charles, our Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Pascal Daloz,
Chief Operations Officer; and Rouven Bergmann, Chief Financial Officer. I would like to welcome you to Dassault
Systemes Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 webcast presentation. At the end of the presentation, we'll take questions
from participants. Later today, we will also hold a conference call.
Dassault Systèmes results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. Most of the financial figures in this conference call
are presented on a non-IFRS basis with revenue growth rate in constant currency unless otherwise noted. For an
understanding of the differences between the IFRS and non-IFRS, please see the reconciliation tables included in our
press release appendix.
Some of the comments we'll make during today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements, which could differ
materially from actual results. Please refer to our risk factors in our 2020 document d’enregistrement universel and 2021
half year annual report.
I will now hand over to Bernard Charles.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Thank you, François-José. Good morning to -- or good afternoon to everyone. It's always a special moment to be
reporting to you the full year and also providing guidance for the subsequent year 2022. So it's even more important
moment for Dassault Systèmes with the expansion on the strengthening of the executive team, and I will cover that.
But let's start on the 2021 highlights. We are very pleased with the achievement of 2021. The revenue was up 11%,
as you have seen it. Operating margin is significantly up also at 34.3%, and resulting in an EPS, up 26% with a great
dynamic, a strong dynamic for 3DEXPERIENCE, the platform, plus 15%. And also, the cloud dynamic, we are pleased
with it, up 23%. So all the elements put together, I think, established a strong base for sustainable growth. And I think it
has to be put in perspective of what happened in 2019, 2020, 2021 and also perspective about our plan for 2024. So we
will cover those topics.
We are walking the talk. I think if you look at what we said and what's happening, I believe that the positioning of the
company that we formulated almost 10 years ago, to say the economy is going towards an experience economy. The
value is in the usage and the experience more than in the product itself. I think it's substantiated almost in every sector
we serve today. And there are so many examples that we see, and I will illustrate a few of them. The second topic that
you have seen is the -- creating a new reach by looking at the economy from the manufacturing sector, everything which
is produced, the life science diversification and also the infrastructure. And finally, the intrinsic evolution of each of those
sectors, at the center of which is the challenge of making the economy more sustainable. I think we are connecting
those dots at Dassault Systèmes, with the Virtual Twin experience and the capacity to systematically use virtual twins to
imagine, create, produce and life cycle things.
And I would like to insist on that point because we are indeed creating virtual works, which are not fake. It's the reality or
the 2B reality. We see it everywhere in mobility, in space, aerospace, new equipment, industrial equipment, autonomous
system, in the way we build and construct things. So indeed, virtual world extend and improves the real world for us. It's
far beyond a Metaverse. It's the improvement of the real world, and this is where we have a unique positioning. And weDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 03, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 5are building experiences that we deliver to clients in 3 of those sectors of the economy. We are building experiences
to design an airplane, produce an airplane, life cycle an airplane, for precision medicine, for construction methods to
have a more sustainable world in cities. And all this is centered on the human side as an actor, as a citizen, an actor or
worker, as a citizen, as a passion, precision medicine. And this is what is represented in the way we are approaching
those industries.
And clearly, today, I must say that we are becoming the de facto industry standard in many of those industry segments
that you know we are positioned. But we are also expanding the reach of what we do from engineering, manufacturing to
really sustainability and supply chain. We represent IFWE, the same IFWE Loop, which is how do you create value, how
do you produce this value, how you create experience and you deliver experiences to clients, citizens? So in some way,
our clients are driving us to expand our platform and software usage to reach their own consumers. That's why the Virtual
Twin experience is really a significant differentiation to understand and build the what, to define how you make it, just an
experience of a bioreactor is an important differentiator for companies as it is for manufacturing companies or virtual twin
experience for health practices is also a significant differentiation.
So there is no need for us to use Metaverse. We use virtual twin experience because it says what it does. Here is a video
that illustrates in the life science sector, that idea.
[Presentation]
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
We continue to focus to be game changer in every sectors we serve. And when we -- you are big game changers, I think
you create long-term sustainable growth, but you also are constrained with the speed at which each market transforms
themselves. So this balance between the speed of market transformation, the game-changing aspect of what we bring is
really becoming visible in manufacturing industries, life science and health care and infrastructure. We believe that this is
exactly why Dassault Systèmes is using science and technology to really serve a more sustainable world.
I would like to take a few examples, which are quite interesting because they illustrate well connecting the dots. We are
deploying the 3DEXPERIENCE platform by performed to an extent ByMe at -- on the cloud at IKEA. At IKEA, the most
important thing is to be inclusive to the consumers when they want to buy, for example, a kitchen. Clearly, what we have
noticed is the incredible fast adoption of basically a Virtual Twin experience in an omnichannel 3D-based approach to
connect the coworkers of IKEA, about 10,000 of them in many countries -- in 53 countries, 83 languages and connecting
them with consumers. I think people never thought Dassault systems could reach consumers that way. And we are taking
it very seriously, as we are for precision medicine or as we are for the way we are going to help build new cities.
So in a few months only, we reached more than 1 million users, and I think it will be multiple millions of users who
are connected with their coworkers to get what they need. This is a good illustration about how powerful the Virtual
Twin experience can help change the relationship between the consumer and the provider of the product and services
associated with it. And more to be seen in this area because as you will see later on, the dynamic with Centric PLM
serving consumer companies, basically, is also extremely strong and was stellar. I think Pascal, if I remember well, about
80% growth last year. So we see vibrant dynamic in this area.
Another example is, of course, in the production environment. The Virtual Twin used for design, production and
optimization and supply chain is also a game changer. It goes far beyond 3D adoption. It's really the systematic approach
to a virtual world to improve what actually happened in the real one. Pirelli is an excellent example of that. And we deliver
not the toolkit, we deliver experience, ready to use to do the job they have to do. We call them industry solutions on
industry processes.
Another example is the adoption of the 3DEXPERIENCE platform by Perrigo, 130 years as a company providing products
for consumers and very differentiating. Then they are using the platform to do what we -- the experience that we call
license to cure, perfect formulation, perfect package. And you -- we all know that this sector is going through a massive
transformation to justify that they are becoming sustainable in terms of the products they use on which they are recycled.
So that's a concrete illustration of the platform phenomenon.
I just used those because some of those are coming. And of course, you may notice that we are strengthening beautifully,
I'm so proud about that, the executive team of Dassault Systèmes. Pascal has been doing -- Pascal Daloz has been doing
an amazing job as both CFO at first. I want to remind everyone that before he was leading all the brands for DassaultDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 03, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 6Systèmes, did the strategy before. So 20 years of experience, understands well the company and expanding his role to
really connect the dots of everything we do with a new generation of executives around him. They are in place, they are
very, very talented. And welcome to Rouven. I'm so pleased that you are here, Rouven, with us around the table, which
shows that we can significant acquisition and promote great talents to be driving the future of Dassault Systèmes, which
will give an incredible possibility for Pascal Daloz to continue to develop as Chief Operating Officer, the performance of
the company and developing this new reach that we need to have. Because the potential that we have built with our new
ambition is very high.
So in conclusion, from my part, what I would like to say is that many of the talented people are joining us because they
love our purpose, harmonizing [indiscernible]. Customers are taking us seriously on sustainability because they know we
can help them build the next-generation portfolio. And this is what they are doing now for the next 5 or 10 years across all
sectors of the industry. So I think that the human dimension, the social dimension of what Dassault Systèmes is doing is
a serious value and needs to be taken into account because I believe this is where Virtual Twin experience can make the
difference.
With that, I give the floor to Pascal.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Thank you, Bernard. Hello, everyone. I hope you are doing well, and thank you for joining us today. So speaking about the
performance, Bernard, let's turn on our financial results. I think the strong business momentum we experienced through
the year continued in the fourth quarter, resulting in performance well aligned with our guidance.
So starting with fourth quarter top line year-over-year comparisons. What could we say? First one, total revenue grew
10% to EUR 1.370 billion, above our 7% to 9% range. The software revenue also grew 10% and all organically, that's
very important to remind. Licenses and other revenue rose 15% to EUR 348 million, well above the guidance and back
to 2019s level, which is also a very important point to notice. Subscription and support revenue increased 8%, driven by
high double-digit subscription growth, reflecting strong Medidata, obviously, contributions but also the 3DEXPERIENCE
performance and also more and more product line like ENOVIA, which is more and more used and consumed through
a subscription model. Recurring revenue represents today 72% of the total software revenue. Zooming on the services
revenue, was up 10%. And I think we achieved services growth margin of an amazing 27.1%, substantially better than --
compared to last year. And I think it's the result of all the efforts we made to improve the efficiency during the pandemic
period. We are at a point where by now, to fulfill all the new projects we signed this year, we probably need to increase
significantly the capacity and continue to develop the ecosystem to make it happen.
From a profitability standpoint, the fourth quarter, we delivered a strong operating margin 36.8%, well in line with our
guidance of 36.4% when you take into account the currency and FX impact. And the EPS grew 17% to EUR 0.29,
compared to our guidance of EUR 0.27 to EUR 0.28.
Now turning to our software revenue performance by geography. The Americas grew 7% during the fourth quarter, driven
by a solid subscription growth. In 2021, the region benefited from a strong performance in High Tech, Transportation
& Mobility, Life Sciences. And you have to remind that now, Americas represent 38% of the total software revenue of
Dassault Systèmes. So clearly, between the geo, we are relatively well balanced, and it was up 13% for the full year.
Europe increased 10%, thanks to the strong resiliency through all the regions. And in 2021, Transportation & Mobility,
Industrial Equipment grew double digits also. And now Europe represents almost the same size in Americas in term of
contribution, so 37% of the total software revenue, up 10% for the full year. Asia, finally, rose 12%, driven by market
expansion. That's to be noticed also because you remember in Asia, we were really focusing on the core industry. And
more and more, we expand outside of the boundary of the auto and aerospace. And it's particularly true in Japan, India
and Southeast of Asia. During the fourth quarter, China grew 10% on the back of a strong base comparison compared to
last year, remember, and 19% over the full year, which is an amazing performance. In 2021, Asia represents 25% of the
software revenue, up 12%.
Now let's zoom on the product line performance. And we're going to start with Industrial Innovation software first. So
the revenue rose 8% to EUR 682.3 million, driven specifically by SIMULIA and DELMIA, which has double-digit growth,
thanks in part to large clients and customer wins. As I was saying, ENOVIA showed a strong subscription growth and
CATIA reached back the '19 level, which is also an important point because we -- with CATIA, we are back on our
trajectory. In Life Sciences, software revenue reached EUR 245.1 million, an increase of 9% for this quarter.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 03, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7Medidata grew 15% on the back again of a strong comparison base. But we continue to see good momentum across
Medidata portfolio, so including Medidata Rave, Medidata AI, Medidata Patient Cloud as well as across end markets,
including, obviously, the pharmaceutical and the biological companies, but also more and more the research -- the
contract research organization and the medical devices as well. We also saw a high double-digit growth in attach rate
against this quarter, which is extremely important because you remember, it was one of the bets at the time of the
acquisition of Medidata.
From a product line perspective, the strong Medidata performance was partially offset by a lower-than-expected BIOVIA
revenue. This was driven by the delay of 2 large renewals. And we expect to sign both renewals during the first half,
so temporary impact. There was also a strong baseline effect with software revenue up 39% in Q4 last year, if you
remember. We are about 1 year into the Life Science engagement model. If you remember a year ago, we decided to
gather all the teams together under the leadership of the Medidata management team and Michael Pray, who is leading
this is doing an outstanding job. And when you look at, we made significant progress and our deal with the Perrigo deal,
Bernard showed is a great example, because it's not only focusing on the clinical trial per se, but more and more to the
rest of the portfolio we are bringing.
So we are about -- we are confident in our strategy to provide life science industry with end-to-end solution that connects,
obviously, ideations, development, manufacturing and commercialization, almost the same way we did in other industries
such as aerospace decades ago. And we believe this is a differentiated capability in the marketplace.
Moving now to the Mainstream Innovation software. Revenue rose 14% to EUR 312.2 million. SOLIDWORKS
delivered strong results with software revenue growth high single digits, and we continue to see good adoption of our
3DEXPERIENCE WORKS family cloud-based solutions during this period, specifically with most of the new logos we are
winning and starting with these product lines. And this is also extremely true in Asia. Centric PLM is performing extremely
well with high double-digit growth revenue. And if we zoom on Centric PLM, I think they are executing extremely well
against this quarter, reaching for the full year the milestone of 550 clients, representing more than 4,500 brands, which is
amazing, and all with a high level of customer satisfaction. And in terms of diversification, you can see we started focusing
on the fashion brands, and to a certain extent, the outdoors and lifestyles. And more and more, we see a good uptake in
food and beverage, cosmetics and personal care and other segments such as also consumer electronics and consumer
goods.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Congratulations to Chris Groves' and his team.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Yes. Now a few words about the growth drivers. Because delivering numbers is good, but relying on the growth drivers
is even better. And now you can see that for the 2021, the 3DEXPERIENCE revenue rose 15%, driven by strong
subscription growth. And it's now representing 30% of the total software revenue, an increase of 2 points compared to last
year. Zooming on the cloud, the cloud revenue increased 23%, driven by obviously the continuous trends in Life Sciences
and 3DEXPERIENCE. But the cloud is -- now accounts for 20% of the total software revenue, up 2 points versus last year.
All clients across all sectors are transforming rapidly. They are turning to Dassault Systèmes, to us, to help them to adopt
the new models, accelerated innovation and brand sustainability imperatives, putting consumer patient citizen at the
center of the experience. And our strategy is really to enable them, to help them this transformation with more and more
cloud-native applications. Our cloud extension to existing on-prem investment when they started a decade ago to adopt
our solutions, that's what the 3DEXPERIENCE platform is allowing us to do. So there is not one single path, there are
multiple paths for the customers to adopt this kind of solution.
Now a few words on the operating margin. So we delivered a strong operating margin of 36.8%. This was well aligned
with our guidance of [indiscernible] when taking into account the currency impact of 40 basis points and also the 30 basis
points coming from higher revenue contributions.
A few words on the headcount. I think in terms of headcount, we are well aligned with our objective. We saw a strong
hiring activity in Q4 and lower attrition. Overall, headcount grew 4% and 6%, specifically for research and development.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 03, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8Given our track record of innovation and our mission-driven culture, I think we are confident in our ability to continue to
attract and retain top talent over the mid, long term. And this is again one of our priorities for 2022.
EPS. The diluted EPS grew 17% to EUR 0.29 when compared to our guidance of EUR 0.27 to EUR 0.28 which is EUR
0.01 more and reaching for the full year at EUR 0.95. This has been driven, obviously, by the top line performance but
also the strong operating leverage we had this year. And this is well reflected into the cash flow and the balance sheet.
Turning to the cash flow. The fiscal year 2021 cash flow from operation was 30% year-over-year to reach EUR 1.613
billion, which is converting almost 1/3 of the revenue to operating cash flow. The cash amounts a little bit less than EUR 3
billion, EUR 2.980 billion, an increase of EUR 831 million versus last year and an increase of EUR 204 million in 2020, just
to have a base of comparison.
Our net financial debt position on December 31, 2021 decreased by EUR 1.152 billion to less than EUR 1 billion to EUR
890 million compared to -- against the EUR 2 billion we had in December last year. This put us a year ahead compared
to our initial schedule on our deleveraging objectives. So I think this is against an outstanding performance and the proof
that we can continue to make large deals -- large transformation deals without compromising the business model and the
ability of the company to continue to invest.
Introductions now to Rouven, because I think to discuss the '22 objective, I'm very pleased to introduce Rouven as our
new Chief Financial Officer. And as Bernard mentioned, Rouven has played a vital role in integrating Medidata. It's a real
pleasure working together in a successful partnerships. So Rouven, you have the floor.
Rouven Bergmann
Thank you, Pascal. And before I start walking through the 2022 financial objectives, I want to say that I'm really excited
and thrilled to be here today with you in this new role. And I really enjoyed the opportunity to meet with some of you
already over the course of the last 2 years and learned from many colleagues at Dassault Systèmes, in particular, you,
Pascal, since the acquisition of Medidata, which, as you know, we've completed about 2 years ago -- a little bit more than
2 years ago. Now after the successful integration, I'm really looking forward to getting to know all of you and the broader
investment community during this year, and I know we will have lots of opportunities to do so.
So with that, let me turn to the full year 2022 financial objectives. We expect the broad-based dynamics we experienced
in the fourth quarter and 2022 to continue into 2022. We are focused on driving durable long-term growth. Our growth
drivers are well established, as highlighted already by Bernard and Pascal. First, we are enhancing our leadership
positions across our major brands. Second, we are accelerating the momentum with 3DEXPERIENCE and industry
solution experiences, winning new customers and expanding significantly within the installed base. Third, we are focused
on delivering new experiences and value with cloud. We will continue the momentum of Medidata and Medidata Patient
Cloud, but we will also expand the user base with the 3DEXPERIENCE WORKS family in the mainstream market and
deliver new value at scale with large enterprise partnerships like what you saw at Renault or Bouygues Construction.
Now with that in mind, we are targeting for full year 2022 total revenue growth of 9% to 10% and software revenue growth
in the same range. Now when thinking about our software revenue growth, please keep in mind that last year, we had
a very strong year of license growth at 23% year-on-year, which brought us back slightly ahead of 2019 levels. Now
for this year, we expect to continue healthy double-digit growth at around 10% -- of up to 12%, which reflects strong
demand within our installed base. And this trend is more in line with what we saw in Q4 of 2021. Now we anticipate
recurring software revenue to increase by 9% to 9.5%, an acceleration of 100 to 150 basis points versus last year, driven
by continued momentum and subscription growth with cloud and solid improvement also in support revenue, which is
also resulting from the very good license growth we experienced throughout 2021. Services revenue is projected to grow
between 8% to 9%, reflecting the increased activity levels of delivering innovation to our clients across all segments with
solid margin performance.
Now from a profitability perspective, this past year, we demonstrated the long-term scalability inherent to our business
model. And as we said throughout 2021, we plan to accelerate investments into our business and reengage in activities
which were impeded by the pandemic. Accelerating the growth in our workforce, of course, in line with our long-term and
midterm plan, is our top priority. As such, we anticipate the non-IFRS operating margin to be in the range of 32.7% and
33.1%. Again, this is consistent with our prior communication.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 03, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9Now let me continue with our proposed objectives for EPS. We expect non-IFRS earnings per share to grow between 3%
to 6%, reaching EUR 1 at the high end. The EPS guidance assumes a tax rate in line with 2021 levels of about 23.2%.
Our financial objectives assume euro to U.S. dollar conversion of about $1.17.
I will provide now some additional color on what to expect for Q1. As you are aware, our business has some level of
seasonality, and we expect to see growth rates progressing throughout the year. We expect Q1 total revenue growth of
7% to 9%, with software revenue increasing in the same range and service revenue up 5% to 7%, driven by continued
broad-based momentum across our geos. We expect the operating margin at a range of 32.3% to 33% with an EPS
growth of 3% to 7% versus last year.
Now as you heard from all of us during this call, we're confident in the long-term opportunity ahead and look forward to
keeping you apprised as we progress throughout the year. And with this, I'd like to hand the call back to Pascal.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Just a few words to conclude. I think Bernard said it, but the stage is set for the future growth, when you think about
it. Our long-term strategic vision has been validated and it's paying off now. The investment we made 10 years ago to
develop the experience economy, whatever we are talking about the platform, the Virtual Twin experiences, our industry
solution and the cloud are a durable competitive advantage. In parallel, I think we are also helping our clients to transform
to a sustainable economy, and it's becoming a real opportunity to deepen and expand our partnership with many of our
customers. So if you combine the two, I think we have a strong secular driver underpinning the growth across almost the 3
major sectors of the economy we want to serve.
In addition, we are convinced we have the right leadership team in place to execute against the tremendous opportunity
before us. And last but not least, our commitment to clients drive our strategy, and thanks to them for their continued trust,
is making also a difference. So -- and finally, I think Rouven and I are, I would say, impatient. We'll be back on the road
and to see you face-to-face of, obviously, in the next coming weeks, if not months.
So I think it's time for the Q&A. Bernard, Rouven and I will now be happy to take your questions.
Bernard S. Charles

Thank you. Roberto, let's ask questions.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 03, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We have the first question from the line of Stacy Pollard from JPMorgan. .
Stacy Elizabeth Pollard
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Two questions from me. First of all, maybe Pascal and Rouven, what are the factors influencing margins, whether you hit
the top end or the bottom end of that range? So for example, how has your hiring been? I know your headcount was up
4%. It seems like you might need to do more there. And then to what degree is wage inflation sort of a factor? So that's
question one.
And the second one, a bit more strategic. Bernard, you already discussed in your opening remarks, but how do you think
about the opportunity in the Metaverse? And is the consumer state something you could target directly? Like is there an
opportunity there? Or is it mainly that you'll sort of interact at the consumer level via the corporate customer?
François-José Bordonado
Vice-President of Investor Relations
Thank you. So Stacy, Pascal -- or maybe Rouven should go.
Rouven Bergmann
Thank you, Stacy, for the question. Yes, for 2022, of course, we are back on track as it relates to the ability to hire and
grow. Q4, we already were able to prove that. The attrition is starting to come down. In Q4, the hiring level was very
healthy. And I think if we look now into 2022, we have -- we are expecting to grow by quarter-over-quarter between 300
and 400 net per quarter. That means we are probably going to hire about 1,000 to 1,200, 1,300 people per quarter. So
that is factored into our guidance and financial objectives. We also are -- because we started to see that traction in the
second half of the year, we carry over this effect into 2022. We have factored this in that as well.
From an inflation standpoint, yes, we are -- we've adjusted our compensation on average, around 5%. And I think
this is the industry norm right now, and it's the right thing to do for our employees. And if you put this all together, of
course, when we talk about margin, we also have to talk about the top line. We are confident in the 9% to 10%. We
see the acceleration in subscription at very healthy margin levels. So I think we are well positioned with regards to the
margin, which the margin, by the way, when you look at it at 33%, that's back at the level of where we were 2019. And
I think that's the level where we believe is a very healthy margin level that gives us the flexibility to do the right level of
investment to take advantage of the secular growth drivers that Bernard and Pascal talked about. And I think that's our job
to ensure that we find the right balance. And I think in 2022 objectives, that's what we've reflected.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Regarding the second question, Stacy, about the topic of Metaverse. We think that, like, by the way, what Tim Cook
has been saying at Apple on that same question, it's about virtual reality. It's about, for us, about virtual twin experience.
This is what we've been doing for 40 years, creating the first digital 3D airplane, cars, now almost everything. I believe
that the great trend to have new devices, what I call, 3D mobile devices to make 3D basic across the society is acting
and accelerating. And the part we will play in terms of opportunities for growth is to help our clients reach their whole
consumers. This is why this morning, I used the incredible showcase of IKEA. It's one example, but in our daily life,
we see how many things we want to buy or we are -- desirable to have in our homes, in our life. And it's very difficult
sometimes if you don't see the real thing to understand, will it fit under the window? Will it fit in your house, whatever.
It's the case very often. It's a question of relationship between you and your life and the things you see on the screen in
the virtual world. This alignment is coming fast. We are proving it with IKEA and many other situations. I call this the 3D
omnichannel approach to really connect with humans.
Same is happening in the medical sector. If you do surgery on the virtual part experience, scale and reality is important
if you want to prepare, first, to educate the patient, to know what the physician are going to do. So it's a huge set ofDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 03, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11opportunities for us, Stacy, and we are playing it. And we call it Virtual Twin experience of the 2B or [indiscernible]. And I
think people understand it very well and our customers love it.
Operator
We have the next question from Michael Briest from UBS.
Michael Briest
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
A couple from me. Just in terms of Medidata, I mean, tough comps in Q4, so I appreciate the slowdown. But could you
talk about the expected growth you see this year for Medidata? And then on the cloud, I think, Pascal, a year ago, you
said it was 17% of 2020 revenues and it's 18% today, not bad news . But if it's 17%, it means all of the recurring revenue
growth was coming from cloud. So can you talk a little bit about the dynamics of the sort of shift from support into cloud,
how much of that's occurring? And I guess in order to get to 33% of revenues in 4 years' time, if it grew 2 points rather
than 3 points last year, you have to accelerate. So what sort of trajectory, and maybe, Rouven, this is for you, would you
expect cloud to be this year in terms of proportion of sales? And is it quite a linear progression? Or will it accelerate in the
outer years?
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Okay. So Rouven, maybe you can take the first one on Medidata. Happy to [indiscernible] .
Rouven Bergmann
Thank you, Michael, for the question. It's a good opportunity to highlight the performance of Medidata. In fact, we see the
sector -- the life sciences sector operating at a very, very high level. We see -- saw the activity and investment level from
a macro perspective, of course, very favorable. The pandemic has really changed the status quo of this industry because,
I think, I wanted to point back to what Bernard said before, where it's really hard to find the right timing in terms of -- when
the right time is when the industry transform, you have to be ready to take advantage of that. And I think Medidata is a
fantastic example where we were investing really ahead of time for many years. And with the change of the pandemic to
the landscape in terms of decentralizing clinical trials, in terms of the importance of AI and data analytics to simulate and
advance evidence generation, Medidata was really ready to take that -- take advantage of this opportunity.
So I'm saying this, Michael, because those trends are here to stay, right? They are not temporary because we were just
elevated by a pandemic. Those trends are here to stay. In 2021, the growth was, of course, elevated because when you
compare it to 2020, we had some softness in the first half of the year of 2020. And we saw that clearly reflected in this
very strong growth in the first 2 to 3 quarters of 2021. In the fourth quarter, Medidata grew 15% plus, so it was more than
15%, but I think very strong because on a very -- on a comparability of a very strong Q4 of 2021 as well. And how has
-- why am I saying this? So bookings levels, we're almost at record level. Our backlog continues to grow at very healthy
double-digit growth to support the 13% to 15% growth range that we have set as our target. And so I think Q4 is a good
representation of what we expect in 2022 in terms of Medidata's growth. So the 13% to 15% growth range is that what we
are targeting. Of course, now at a business that's almost at $1 billion in revenue where you have a certain baseline effect
as well. So you really have to factor that in into the growth calculation.
From a growth driver standpoint, Medidata continues to grow through the expansion into Patient Cloud and data analytics
and AI, which continues to drive a broad-based portfolio, supporting the growth objective. So with that.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Okay. So the second question you asked, Michael, was related to the cloud. As I was telling you, it's 2 points, 200
basis points more in the mix of the total software revenue this year, so 20% compared to 18% last year. If you look at
the different contributors, right now, Medidata is by far the largest contributor to the cloud dynamic, around -- a little bit
around 80%. 20% is coming from the rest, the rest being specifically ENOVIA, CATIA and, to a certain extent, SIMULIA
as well. Where we see the mix in terms of the different contributors going for the next few years, it will be much more
balanced. So I do expect Medidata, in the objective I gave, to be 1/3 of the revenue in 2025 to be around 60% -- 60%,
65%, which basically means the rest will grow faster. And the rest will be specifically ENOVIA where we see more and
more the customer adopted the subscriptions and the cloud model for them because it's very suitable for the collaborativeDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 03, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12environment and is giving the flexibility with the name user approach we have generalized. SIMULIA because the
computing power is also something, giving the ability to have those kind of solutions, being affordable for also the
mainstream and the midsized market. So we see traction along this way. And the WORKS family is also benefiting of this.
And last but not least, the new generation of SOLIDWORKS is definitively, I mean, very suitable for the cloud approach
because it's a way, obviously, to get access to the feature and the functionality, but it's a way to connect with easily with
the rest of the portfolio we have. And that's the most important right now.
And the second thing is the 3DEXPERIENCE platform is becoming the cornerstone also for the mainstream market. And
the only way to make it affordable is also through the cloud. So if you combine all those elements, you will be -- you will
land with the mix, which is the one I just described. So from 80% to Medidata contributions to 60%, 65%. The rest will be
all the product line I just described.
Michael Briest
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
But how would you expect to add about 300 basis points a year? Or will it be more back-end loaded than that?
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
No. I mean, it's -- Bernard said in an elegant way, he said you could have the solution. There is one thing you are not
mattering is the market adoption. So the mainstream is probably something we could control because it's much more push
than a pull. But when you are talking about large customers, take the example of Renault, I mean, you need a lot of point
to be connected and aligned before to have a large company like Renault to take the decision to move 100% to the cloud.
So all the large customers we have a 10-year road map, all of them. So the problem is not anymore a road map. But none
of them we shipped over the night. And that's the reason why you could accept that from 1 year to another one, you could
have some volatility, I would say, in terms of the contributions because the whys -- I mean, it would have been -- if we
would have been able to give you with precise numbers when the customer will migrate means we are in full control of
their decision process, which is not fully the case.
Operator
We have the next question from Mohammed Moawalla from Goldman Sachs. .
Mohammed Essaji Moawalla
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
I had a couple from my end as well. Firstly, Bernard, obviously, we're hearing IT spending and the broader environment
is very robust. We're also seeing kind of larger, more kind of strategic engagements happening across the different sort
of segments within software. I'm just curious from your vantage point, as we're kind of now coming out of the pandemic,
we saw the Renault deal, but how do you see sort of some of these bigger strategic engagement discussions developing?
And how should we see that sort of coming through in terms of your business and not just on the kind of the core
automotive or transportation mobility and side but also in life sciences? If you could comment on that and how you expect
those sort of sales cycles to develop.
Second question, obviously, I think you alluded to this, Pascal, that the balance sheet has kind of delevered ahead of
your expectations. And you're looking to continue to diversify. So can you remind us again in terms of kind of your kind of
approach on M&A? What are the kind of particular verticals that are perhaps a part today in making the strategic news of
-- given where different industries are digitizing? So have you -- is your thinking there kind of changed to accelerate the
process?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
More on the first item, which is clearly for our existing base, the arbitration towards going to experiences, as Pascal just
said it, very clear in their customer road map. It's not anymore a question of should we do it. It's about how do we stage
it. It's very clear on, I think, it's creating, I think, a strong visibility for us. The second thing that it has as an effect related
to your question is it's creating a new reach. For example, at Renault, but I could also mention other clients like Airbus
or even Boeing now with their massive transformation going on. The platform is becoming a platform used for costing,
supply. So not only engineering, but manufacturing engineering, optimization of the plant, evaluation of the product inDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 03, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 13operation. We mentioned Schindler a few months ago where we really are really evaluating the introduction of the platform
to support the world installed base of elevators on escalators. So that, a world of reach that was not possible without
the platform, are now becoming available. So we are very cautious to put the pie up for growth. Dassault Systèmes is
a system. We put the pilots for growth first and then we build on them. And so that's what is happening. So we are very
confident on -- I have to tell you, the mood with the customers to really embrace the platform phenomenon is very strong.
And we -- I remind that we mentioned Toyota in the past, Bouygues. We mentioned Renault now. We mentioned Boeing
at some point in time. We mentioned Airbus. I mentioned Schindler. I could take a lot -- a long list of those clients and say,
this move is on and we will not stop.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Regarding the balance sheet situation. So you're right, Mo, we will be fully deleveraged somewhere H1 this year 2022,
which gives us room to maneuver. The M&A policy has always been the same. We have the bolt-on. So it's an ongoing
flow of acquisition we do for almost -- on the road between EUR 100 million and EUR 300 million per year. And then you
have -- because I think this is your question, the big move we can do. So we have big move. We could consider in all the
3 sectors of the economy at parity, I mean, in terms of where do we want to focus? If you continue to put pressure on the
tech sectors, maybe some of them will become affordable for us. So that's probably the only good news of the situation
right now. But do not expect that I will disclose our thinking process during this call. You have to wait a little bit.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
On the dynamics, I forgot to ask to answer the question on you specifically said also on life science, connecting the dots.
Let me be clear on that. We use Perrigo on purpose, and we have many other customers where they were Medidata only.
And now they are seeing the value of bioreactors, so Virtual Twin for bioreactors. They are seeing the value on the front
end in research with BIOVIA on what we call ONE lab, which is an excellent showcase about how we connect research,
lab, clinical trial and bioreactor. So the showcases are there. And in fact, it's a discovery for this industry, as Rouven said.
That sector was more document-based than fully virtualization-based and is discovering the virtualization as opposed to
just digitizing basic documents. So it's a very -- and we need to calibrate how fast we go because we want to make them
successful.
Mohammed Essaji Moawalla
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
Rouven, just as we think about sort of the Q1 guidance, the cost simply from the kind of tough comparisons? Or is there
because -- I think on the recurring side, the comp is not as tough. So just can you help us kind of understand the thinking
around the kind of recurring guidance you've given at least the bottom comp, what kind of portion is that?
Rouven Bergmann
I think, Mo, the simple answer is we are growing progressively throughout the year. We are forecasting 100 to 150
basis points improvement in recurring revenue, certainly driven by accelerated growth in the subscription line but also
in recovery of support because -- as a result of the very strong performance in licenses in 2021. And we just want to
gradually progress into the year. And I think we've -- it's a good and prudent way to structure the full year outlook. And so
there -- that's the summary. There's no systematic headwind for Q1. It's simply -- we are progressing from a very solid Q4
where we were in recurring revenue at the low end of our range, targeting acceleration in recurring revenue in 2022. And
we are progressively doing that through Q1 and the rest of the year.
Operator
The next question from James Goodman from Barclays. .
James Arthur Goodman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Maybe we can pick up on 3DEXPERIENCE to begin with. And could you quantify -- and apologies if I missed it,
but the performance there on the license side this quarter? Maybe just provide some broader context around the
3DEXPERIENCE adoption. It just looked like sort of slowed a little bit in terms of year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter
despite the overall license performance. So just wondering what the puts and takes there are.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 03, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 14And then more broadly, could you perhaps make some commentary around the behaviors you're seeing from your
customers in different industries as it relates to the supply chain constraints, so broadly impacting parts of your customer
base at the moment. I'm thinking about the opportunities it provides a data, the necessity to sort of accelerate certain
adoption of your solutions. But also whether there's been any timing impact from a financial perspective just as a
consequence of some of the challenges those businesses are facing.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Rouven, you want to take the first one? But before to do this, I want to make one comment. Be careful not to look at only
the license for 3DEXPERIENCE platform because we are more and more subscriptions coming from 3DEXPERIENCE.
So if you are looking for an early indicators in terms of the momentum, you need to combine the 2. Rouven, would answer
to the question.
Rouven Bergmann
Yes. And I think we mentioned it before that for 3DEXPERIENCE, we saw very strong momentum in the fourth quarter
in the subscription line and overall very, very strong growth in 2022 with very healthy growth rates in total. So when we
look at Q4, you mentioned maybe some slowdown, if I correctly understood your question. I think Q4 was -- we were
ahead of our consensus, our own objectives that we set. Q4, also, you have to factor in the year-over-year comparison. I
think Q4 of 2020 was the first real benchmark for us in 2021. And I think compared to that, we've shown very, very good
durable growth. I also want to highlight the fact that the growth was broad-based, right? If you look across the geos, if
you look into Asia, for example, 12% growth, China, very, very strong growth. But also the resilience in Europe and core
markets, transportation, mobility, industrial equipment. So it's really coming from the core industries and the core pillars of
the company. So Q4 was good.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
On the supply chain side, it's a very interesting and challenging situation for many industries. I see 3 factors. I meet a lot
of customers, thanks to Pascal. He's really running the operations. So I have time to spend time with clients, and I love
to do that. I see 3 factors and many of them are not well understood by many observers in the economy. One of them is
related to the effect of sustainability, is reframing the value chain. Of course, the very first which everyone talks about is
the availability of components, on those kind of things. And the second factor is related to the logistics. The third factor is
related to the transformation of the supply chain to value chain. Let me comment on the 3 of them.
Of course, on the availability of certain resources of components or materials, I think it's opening the eyes of many, many
companies to better master the decision process of how they work with those suppliers. Up to now, it was purely cost-
driven. For years, in the last 15 years, I've been following this industry and transforming it for 40 years, I can tell you,
and I have a very precise data on it. Now it's moving from a cost to a more reliability, trust and proximity. The second
thing related to the supply chain is the reshaping of who plays in the value chain because when you create new product
portfolio which are more sustainable, you change formulation for cosmetics, you change materials for manufacturing.
And this is going to accelerate. This is why we have a platform which is absolutely unique because we do those kind of
simulation, the what if. Believe me, this is not the next 2 years. This is for the next 20 years that it will drive the growth of
what we do. And finally, on the logistics thing. Yes, there was the congestion related to a slowdown and now comeback.
But I think there is a deeper problem, which is when people are going to start to seriously report ESG and the cost of
logistics, they will change their mind about proximity. And we talked about near-shoring in the past for engineering. It has
happened in Europe, for example. But we will see a new proximity in terms of production because the ESG factor on the
sustainable reporting for companies is going to enforce to not optimize on cost, but optimize on other criteria. That's, in
short, where we are playing and why the platform is unique to solve it.

Next question from Charles Brennan from Jefferies. The next question from Amit Harchandani from Citi. .
Amit B. Harchandani
Citigroup Inc. Exchange ResearchDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 03, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15Amit Harchandani from Citi. Two questions, if I may. My first question goes back to the performance in licenses and
other. And if you could please help us better understand the underlying drivers of the guidance for 2022 in terms of any
particular product lines that you would call out sectors or the underlying strength of 3DEXPERIENCE adoption. So that
would be the first question.
The second question goes back to the topic of 3D EXPERIENCE more broadly. You've talked about it being 30% in -- of
software in 2021. The objective is 2/3 by 2025. Could you help us understand how we should think about the trajectory
over the medium term and as it may, break down between licenses and recurring revenue?
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Thank you. So Rouven, you take the first one, and I will take the second one.
Rouven Bergmann
Sure. So thank you for the question. We have -- as you -- as discussed, for the license, we are projecting 10% to 12%
revenue growth -- license revenue growth year-over-year. It compares to 15% in Q4 of last year. So what are the drivers?
So we have seen very durable performance of our major brands, of our major solutions of the platform, certainly if you
look at into the -- into our core markets of Industrial Innovation, which is back to 2019 levels. And you know we have a
lot of our installed base that is constantly with very strong renewal rates, where we constantly expand our footprint in our
core offerings. I think that's where the majority of the license revenue in Industrial Innovation continues to come from.
And I mentioned that in my prepared remarks, it's because of our very strong installed base. So our license model is very
well established, and we see that to continue while we are increasing our recurring revenue by 100 to 150 basis points in
2022.
If you look into the Life Sciences sector, maybe to give you some color there. With the Life Sciences engagement that
we've created 2 years ago, we talked about this, Pascal mentioned it. We are in a transition to accelerate the subscription
revenue growth across the brands outside of Medidata, which is already fully subscription. And if you look into our
mainstream market, of course, SOLIDWORKS has a strong installed base of licenses. But as well, with our focus on
3DEXPERIENCE and the SOLIDWORKS family, we are progressively moving towards a subscription and cloud model.
But nevertheless, I think the 10% to 12% of license growth is on a very strong foundation for 2022.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Okay. So related to the 3DEXPERIENCE platform momentum and the KPI which I shared with you at the Capital Markets
Day almost 3 years ago. You have to remind something, when I did it, it was only on 1 sector of the economy, which
was largely the manufacturing sectors. So now we are expanding into 2 new sector economy, which is life sciences and
infrastructure, where the penetration rate of the 3DEXPERIENCE platform is low. And if combined, it represents more
than 30% of the total revenue of Dassault Systèmes. So if you want to compute my number, you should keep in mind that
when I gave to you 2/3 was really related to the manufacturing sector first, point number one.
Point number two, if you look at all the industry within the manufacturing sectors, it's relatively simple. The core industry,
namely auto, transportation and mobility, aerospace and defense, industrial equipment, the penetration rate is between
40% to 50%. If you look at the others, it's much more close to 20%, which is, for you, a way to understand where the
levers are coming from. So that's basically, if you want to modelize and to follow this KPI in a proper way, the way you
should look at it and how you should input your model in order to assess if we walk the talk.
Operator
We have the next question from Frederic Boulan from Bank of America.
Frederic Emile Alfred Boulan
BofA Securities, Research Division
Two questions from my side. First of all, on the Life Science segment, if you can spend a moment talking about your
positioning in the value chain. And is there any specific segment that you think could be interesting to develop further?
And then on the infrastructure and cities segment, if you can discuss a little bit the traction you're having here, and if you
think there is some need to develop either the product or the distribution capabilities, either organically or nonorganically.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 03, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Frederic. On the positioning on the value chain for Life Science, I think we are demonstrating that the
Medidata enterprise solution can be massively expanded to become a platform for distributed clinical trial. I think that's a
big step because it points out on the fact that one day we want to really have an infrastructure for patient journey. It's a
good preparation for that.
The second, in the value chain, if I take your question exactly with the value chain, there is no doubt that this industry
is far suboptimized when it comes to production. It's far from what has been done in -- I think if a rich company is not
optimizing at all their infrastructure for production for bioreactors, on new production infrastructure. And so there is a lot
to play there. They are far from using the lean TPS of -- Toyota Production System. It's unknown to them. The reviews of
equipment is very low. The agility to ramp up is far from being what it should be. I don't want to be negative and insulting
our potential customers, but we understand what production is about. The certification process is document-based. This
would never happen anymore for an airplane. So that's on the value chain from producing things. If you think about
personalized medicine, there is another phenomenon. We will have units -- smaller units producing smaller body quantity
of very specific therapeutics. I think this is what more than has in mind, and the industry is not ready for that.
On the front end, if I go now backward on the research, there is a lot to be done on the -- not only looking on price, we
focus on that, but on the research lab on the unification of lab discipline, which is related to cooperation. Most of the
companies in the pharma sector has massively fragmented R&D, most of them. It's isolated R&D PC. They don't talk
to each other. We see that now with 3DEXPERIENCE One lab, we are connecting the dots that never were connected
before. And not to speak about the lab work itself, which by the way, if you go and visit, you would see that most of them
are reentering data for lab. So a lot of things to be done in value chain. Of course, the companies are challenged. All of
them are challenged on new therapeutics, new research. And maybe this is why this discipline of connecting and creating
digital pipeline is not there. But I think we are revealing to them now, with Dassault Systèmes, with the new reach that we
can do a lot more. So I think it's not a negative comment to say that they are several decades behind in other sectors and
that we can make the difference going forward on the back -- this is on the value chain.
Pascal Daloz
COO, CFO & Director
Infrastructure, you want to say?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Infrastructure briefly, we continue -- first of all, we continue to make showcases. As Pascal said, the way we're expanding
just on Bouygues with all new projects with new players involved on the same platform, is just impressive. We need more
of that. That's our challenge. And to your remark about is it a question of portfolio or is it a question of reach on capacity,
I would admit that we need to find ways to expand on the capacity because what we have offered up to now is working,
giving results. Conducting the transformation and capacity to reach is probably a weak point for Dassault Systèmes to
date.
Thank you very much. Pascal, Rouven. Thank you very much. I feel very comfortable. You are a great leadership. It's
great news for me. Have to spend more time with customers, and this is what I love on technology and science, too.
So with all of that, hopefully, see you soon and enjoy your day. We will continue to walk the talk and be one of the best
reliable company to deliver on what we said.

Operator
Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Dassault Systèmes '22 Q1 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]
Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded, Wednesday, the 27th of April 2022. [Operator Instructions]
I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, François Bordonado. Please go ahead.
François-José Bordonado
Vice-President of Investor Relations
Thank you, Heidi. Thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call with Bernard Charlès, Vice
Chairman and CEO; Pascal Daloz, Chief Operating Officer; and Rouven Bergmann, Chief Financial Officer.
As you know, Dassault Système results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. Most of the financial figures discussed on
this conference call are on a non-IFRS basis with revenue growth rate in constant currencies unless otherwise noted.
Some of our comments on this call contain forward-looking statements that could differ materially from actual results.
Please refer to today's press release and the Risk Factors section of our 2021 Universal Registration Document. All
earnings materials are available on our website, and these prepared remarks will be available shortly after this call.
I would like now to introduce Bernard Charlès.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Thank you, François-José. Good morning and good afternoon to all of you and thank you for joining us. It's truly a
pleasure to be with you in person today.
We delivered a good start to the year with broad-based growth across regions, product lines and sectors despite the
complex geopolitical and macroeconomic backdrop.
For the first quarter 2022, the total revenue grew 8% with both licenses and subscription revenue up double digits, and
this follows a high 2021 comparison base. Earning per share increased 20% driven by operating leverage, thanks to our
strong business model. Our strategic growth drivers performed well. 3DExperience and cloud revenue both increased
21%. Our platform on cloud have been critical for enabling resiliency and for helping clients to scale rapidly, both the new
entrants and the incumbents transforming. For 2022, we have increased our EPS objective to 9% to 11% growth driven by
our improved operating performance.
It's clear from our results this quarter the team we have established is executing very well on capitalizing on our
sustainable growth drivers. The investment we have made in innovation are paying off for our clients across all sectors of
the economy. Pascal and Rouven will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail soon.
Now I'd like to share some perspective on our strategy on the business environment.
The world economy and society are transforming at an unprecedented pace. With science-based virtual twin experience,
we are playing a critical role in this transformation, empowering our clients to solve their greatest challenges from
resiliency to sustainability. By combining a multi-scale multi-physics approach with embedded analytics and real-world
evidence, virtual twin experiences are a catalyst for sustainable innovation to imagine, create, test new materials, new
processes, new solutions and new usages.
We have recently introduced the Life Cycle Assessment Solution on the 3DEXPERIENCE platform to transform the
sustainable innovation process. Combining virtual twin technology and life cycle assessment capabilities offers new ways
to establish sustainability requirements early on and measure the sustainability of decisions before actually implementing
them.
You may remember our science-based targets for greenhouse gas emissions reductions were approved by the Science-
Based Targets initiative last July 2021. It's clear from that perspective we walk the talk. This new solution is a majorDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL  APR 27, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 5advancement towards our purpose to harmonize product, nature and life. By leveraging the virtual worlds to elevate and
improve the real world, together we can drive meaningful progress towards a more sustainable and harmonious future.
Our next frontier will be to make the power of virtual twin experiences accessible to everyone on the planet to make these
virtual twin experiences mainstream. I've talked about strategy to see the implication. Let me now share a couple of proof
points.
Today, I want to focus on Life Sciences. Our teams are delivering incredible innovation and execution to advance clinical
trials on new treatments for patients. Virtualization and AI are changing the game, MEDIDATA Synthetic Control Arm,
SCA, leverages AI, our unique data assets, on over 28,000 clinical trials. With SCA, we can virtualize the patient for the
clinical trial control arm, the third arm of the clinical trial. This accelerates innovation, reduces cost and, most importantly,
fosters a more compassionate approach.
For some disease, it's very difficult to recruit and maintain a control group. MEDIDATA Synthetic Control Arm can enable
these trials to move forward and advanced treatments. Our recent announcement with Celsion and Plus Therapeutics
highlight the potential of these true revolutionary innovations. Of course, we work in conjunction with FDA to provide these
unmatched capabilities and ultimately achieve better outcomes for patients.
Another groundbreaking innovation is BIOVIA's Generative Therapeutics Design. By combining AI, chemistry and
structure-based modeling, we can accelerate drug discovery with virtual creation, testing and selection of novel
candidates. We are delivering on a promise to bring new science and new opportunities to increase the pipeline of
potential therapeutics.
Gilead has selected BIOVIA's technology to advance its discovery of new drugs and its commitment to a patient-first
approach to medicines. Innovation is about progress. Ultimately, all progress is humans. With these technologies, we are
extending our handprint, having a real positive impact on society, improving people's lives.
And now I will hand the presentation over to Pascal to continue the discussion.
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Thank you, Bernard. Hello, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you today.
As Bernard said, all progress is humans, and relationships are essential in driving and realizing the value of innovations.
This underpins our strategy across all the sectors of the economy.
Remember, our objective is to be the trusted partner to support our clients, both incumbent and new entrants, with a
game-changing innovation and to maintain our relationship over the long time for a reason. And of course, we have made
many historical examples, but let's look at some of the current proof points we have.
Starting with contract research organizations. Today, having supported more than 28,000 clinical trials globally,
MEDIDATA is a trusted partner of the top CROs, including ICON, LabCorp, Parexel, IQVIA and many, many others.
Our world-leading technology are the industry standard not only to support but also to operate and execute clinical trials
across all the different phases. The larger CROs are standardizing on MEDIDATA Rave as it's the only integrated platform
that combines AI, patient engagement and clinical data management and this at scale.
The value we provide to our CRO partners is a competitive advantage in their ability to help sponsor, deliver drugs to
market faster and much more efficiently and ultimately advancing our collective mission.
Another example also in the Life Sciences is Boehringer Ingelheim. We have been building a long-standing relationship
of trust with Boehringer over the last decade. So it's a pleasure to announce that Boehringer Ingelheim has renewed and
broadened what we do with them, expanding from MEDIDATA Rave to MEDIDATA AI and MEDIDATA Patient Cloud
to accelerate the decentralized clinical trial. Our partnership has enabled Boehringer Ingelheim to double the number of
image studied each year since 2018. And it also supports ongoing trial with thousands of patients and hundreds of global
sites. We look forward to continuing to support Boehringer missions through the next decades.
Turning now to the manufacturing sector. To deliver sustainable product experiences, consumer company need an
integrated approach to product development, one that includes modeling for rapid formulations. And keep in mind that
many of those companies, they have to reformulate their entire product portfolio in the coming years to be compliant withDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL  APR 27, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 6new regulations like [ HICH ] and manufacturing and -- for manufacturing and sustainability. To manage this tremendous
complexity, it requires our science-based 3DEXPERIENCE platform with its multi-scale and multi-physics approach.
We are seeing significant momentum in the consumer packaged goods industry and much more specifically in health and
beauty because after having L'Oréal, L'Occitane, now we are proud to announce that Shiseido has decided to go with
us to extend its leadership position and meet rising demand. The company is producing over 100 million SKU annually
and introducing new product experience daily. So we are pleased to support Shiseido initiative with our manufacturing
solutions, including Perfect Production and 3DEXPERIENCE, to streamline manufacturing across Asia, Europe, U.S. to
increase resiliency, boost productivity and accelerate product launches.
In Infrastructure & Cities, energy is at the core of the current resiliency and sustainability challenges. We are seeing
new entrants bringing truly disruptive innovation, similarly to what we saw play out in Transportation & Mobility and also
much more recently in aerospace. These newcomers are adopting our technology on 3DEXPERIENCE platform and on
the cloud. To advance sustainability, NAAREA a start-ups, is developing nuclear reactors that are small, modular and
utilize industrial ways to produce energy. To support its ambitions, the company has selected virtual twin experience and
3DEXPERIENCE and also the cloud for design, simulation and validation with the end-to-end traceability. We are looking
forward to following NAAREA progress and (sic) [ as ] it makes nuclear energy safer, more reliable and sustainable.
As you can see, the investment we made a decade ago are paying off for our clients and are testimony to the value we
bring to our relationships.
Now I want to turn to our first quarter 2022 results.
Revenue growth was broad based across geographies product lines and sectors, demonstrating the diversification we
have achieved in our addressable market as well as the quality of our execution.
Starting with our geo. In the first quarter, the software revenue increased by 7% in Americas to reach 40% of the software
revenue. This was driven by a strong performance in Life Sciences and aerospace. In Europe, Europe increased 6% to
35% of the software revenue despite our suspension of operation in Russia. We saw a good resilience throughout the
regions, and France and Southern of Europe grew double digits, led by aerospace and Industrial Equipment. Asia Pacific
rose 13% to 25% of the software revenue driven by an acceleration in Japan, Korea and India and a good momentum
which continues to be very high in China, with China growing at 20% during the quarter on a strong comparison basis.
Now let's zoom on the product line performance for the first quarter of 2022.
Industrial Innovation software revenue rose 5% to EUR 654.4 million, representing 54% of the software revenue. CATIA
demonstrated a very strong performance driven by double-digit license and subscription growth and punctuated by cyber
systems, showing the strength of these differentiated offerings. ENOVIA also reported high double-digit growth in both
license and subscription software revenue.
In Life Sciences, revenue grew 13% in the first quarter to EUR 254 million and representing 21% of the software revenue.
MEDIDATA delivered a strong performance, growing double digits again this quarter, and MEDIDATA continued to
experience very good momentum across its product portfolio, including MEDIDATA Rave, MEDIDATA AI and MEDIDATA
Patient Cloud, as well as the across end markets, including pharmaceutical and biotechno companies and contract
research organization. BIOVIA also performed well, achieving a double-digit growth during the period.
Moving to Mainstream Innovation, software revenue increased 12% and to EUR 297.2 million, representing 25% of
the software revenue. SOLIDWORKS continued to perform well, growing double digits and on the back of a strong
comparison base of 18% growth in Q1 last year. Our 3DEXPERIENCE WORKS family, the cloud-based solutions, are
also showing good adoption during this period. And CENTRIC PLM delivered another quarter of high double-digit growth
as well as gain in diversification in food and beverage.
As you can see, our growth was broad based across product lines and brands. And both CATIA and SOLIDWORKS have
demonstrated a strong momentum and performed extremely well.
So in -- I just want to remind you that in the design market, we are ranked first and at more than twice of the size of the
second player. Every year, we gain a remarkable 0.5% market share, and we achieve this by converting 2D to 3D users,
displacing 3D competitors and expanding our footprint in our large installed base. We therefore ask the financial analysts
who are reusing the industry analyst report without checking the figure it contained to take a critical approach beforeDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL  APR 27, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7spreading wrong information. This critical approach would have been revealed significant inconsistencies, in particular
with one of our competitors' reported figures.
Now turning to our strategic growth drivers. And again, these are year-to-year growth in constant currency.
In the first quarter of 2022, we continued to see a very good 3DEXPERIENCE momentum with revenue increasing 21%
driven by subscription growth. and 3DEXPERIENCE now account for 30% of the total software revenue, an increase of 5
points relatively -- relative to last year.
Cloud revenue also raised 21% driven by continued strength in Life Sciences and 3DEXPERIENCE. Cloud now accounts
for 21% of our software revenue, up 2 points versus last year.
3DEXPERIENCE and cloud are critical for enabling resiliency and helping our clients to scale rapidly and against both the
new entrants and the incumbents transforming. As you can see from our results, our growth drivers are well balanced and
durable.
And I think now I will hand over the presentation to Rouven to discuss revenue, profitability and our 2022 objectives.
Rouven, the floor is yours.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Thank you, Pascal. Hello, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you on this call today.
I'm very pleased with our first quarter 2022 performance. Clearly, we are off to a good start. We delivered strong revenue
growth, well aligned with our Q1 objectives, and we did this on the back of a relatively high 2021 comparison base.
From a profitability perspective, we outperformed while, at the same time, we continued to make strategic investments
in our business and achieved our ambitious hiring targets. EPS are up a strong 20% for the quarter at EUR 0.27. These
results clearly highlight the resiliency and the momentum of our business model. And we achieved these results despite
the negative impact from discontinuing our business in Russia with EUR 5 million in lower revenue and EUR 2.5 million of
additional expenses to cover litigation risk when compared to our Q1 objectives.
Now let's look at our Q1 year-over-year comparisons for revenue. And the growth rates that I will be highlighting here are
all in constant currency and non-IFRS.
Total revenue grew 8% to EUR 1.32 billion. Software revenue also grew 8%, including the impact of Russia, as I
mentioned earlier. Licenses and other revenue rose 10% to EUR 235 million and against a strong comparison base
of 25% growth in the first quarter of 2021. Subscription and support revenue increased 8% to EUR 971 million driven
by double-digit subscription growth, reflecting strong MEDIDATA and 3DEXPERIENCE performance as well as a
strengthening in our support revenue, as expected. Services revenue was up a strong 9%, and we achieved service
revenue -- services gross margins at 16%, substantially better than last year, which was 12%, thanks to the efforts we
made to improve our utilization.
Now let's zoom in on our Q1 operating margins and EPS.
We delivered a strong operating margin of 35%, outperforming our target of 32.7% by 230 basis points at the midpoint
and on a year-over-year basis increasing 117 basis points. This was driven by lower discretionary spend such as travel,
marketing and event activity, which were lower than planned due to continued travel restrictions in certain parts of the
world. Also, we saw good improvement in operating performance.
The impact of discontinuing our business in Russia was offset by the revenue upside and a marginal favorable currency
impact on the operating margin level. At the same time, we are well aligned with our hiring objectives. Total headcount
grew 7% and -- year-over-year. And within the R&D function, we are actually up 9% year-over-year.
We also saw diluted EPS above the high end of our guidance, growing a strong 20% or approximately EUR 0.035 to EUR
0.27 compared to our guidance of the range of EUR 0.23 to EUR 0.24. This was driven by strong operating performance,
as mentioned earlier, contributing EUR 0.02 to the overall performance. In addition, FX contributed EUR 0.8 and lower
taxes, EUR 0.7.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL  APR 27, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8Just one comment regarding the tax rate. The lower rate in the first quarter 2022 is mainly the result of a higher FDII
tax deduction in the United States resulting from the new requirement effective January 1, 2022, to fully capitalize
R&D expenditures for tax purposes. At the time when we issued the guidance, we -- it was assumed that capitalization
requirements would be canceled for the year.
Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet items.
Cash and cash equivalent equivalents totaled EUR 3,009,000,000 compared to EUR 2,979,000,000 at the end of last
year, an increase of EUR 29 million.
Our net financial debt at March 31, 2022, so by the end of Q1 2022, decreased by EUR 257 million to a negative EUR 632
million compared to a negative EUR 889 million at December 31, 2021. This puts us well ahead of the schedule of our
deleveraging objective.
And I'm sure in this context, you noted that our cash and operating performance is reflected in the improvement of our
Standard & Poor's credit rating from a single A- to a single A, as it has been announced yesterday evening.
Now let me provide some additional color on what is driving our cash position this quarter.
First, cash from operations was EUR 630 million, which is slightly down versus last year in part driven by onetime items
and the timing of changes in working capital. Second, we continued to repay our debt, loan repayments of EUR 232
million. Third, cash from operations was used for treasury stock repurchases of EUR 328 million. This comprises our long-
term incentive plan for 2022 as well as our shareholder participation plan. This number is higher than last year as we took
advantage of market fluctuations and purchased our shares at a relative discount in Q1. Also, I want to remind you that
our policy regarding equity compensation is unchanged, specifically 5% of our revenue as share-based compensation
expense.
So now let's focus on cash from operations, EUR 630 million, representing a slight decrease of 2% year-over-year. Now I
want to remind you that this compares to a 40% increase last year, so resulting in a higher comparison base this quarter.
What are the major drivers of the slight decline this year? First, we saw a lower decrease in trade receivables resulting
from higher billings at the end of the quarter despite strong collections of our Q4 receivables. The trade balance is up,
reflecting strong business growth in Q1. Regarding the impact on cash, we expect to catch up, and this trend will reverse
in the coming quarters.
Second, accrued compensation. The decrease in accrued compensation was much higher year-over-year due to the
strong business results in 2021 that drove higher bonus payments in the first quarter of 2022.
And third, we received a onetime withholding tax reimbursement in the first quarter of 2021, resulting in a higher
unfavorable comparison base when we look at our first quarter results.
Now let's turn to our fiscal 2022 objective.
First, total revenue. We are reaffirming our total revenue growth rate objective of 9% to 10% in constant currency but
to a slightly higher absolute range of EUR 5.355 billion to EUR 5.405 billion, incorporating an update to the U.S. dollar
rate from initially $1.17 to now $1.15 for the remainder of 2022. This adjustment to our currency assumption, along with
the first quarter FX benefit, has a EUR 67 million impact on our total revenue objective. In addition, we are reflecting
the impact of Russia, which is negative EUR 21 million for the year-end revenue, as well as incorporating our Q1
overperformance. So with the FX adjustment, we are more than compensating the loss of revenue from discontinuing our
business in Russia.
Second, let me turn to the operating margin. We are increasing our full year objective to the range of 33.4% to 33.7%, a
raise of approximately 65 basis points at the midpoint. This increase mainly reflects our strong operating leverage and
lower travel and marketing expenses in the first half. And importantly, it also reflects continued execution against our
ambitious hiring targets throughout the rest of the year. We are more than offsetting the negative impact of Russia.
Third, turning now to the EPS. We are raising our 2022 diluted EPS objective up to 9% to 11% growth, as reported,
reaching EUR 1.04 to EUR 1.06. This compares to previously 3% to 6% growth, reaching EUR 0.98 to EUR 1 previously.
The FX benefit of EUR 0.014 almost offsets, again, the negative impact from Russia. In addition, we are capturing Q1DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL  APR 27, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9overperformance as well as reflecting the change in tax rates for the first quarter only. This results in a full year tax rate of
22.5% compared to 23.2% previously.
As it relates to the revenue components reflected in our updated total revenue objective, we are targeting software
revenue growth of 9% to 10%, licenses and software revenue growth of 10% to 12% and recurring revenue growth of
approximately 9%. Service revenue is targeted at the range of 8% to 10%, all at constant currency.
So before closing, let me also briefly share our objectives for the second quarter.
Total revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 9% to 11% with license revenue in the range of 14% to 19%,
recurring revenue of 8% to 9% and services revenue of 9% to 11% at constant currency. Operating margin of 31.7% to
32.4% and diluted EPS growth of 11% to 16% -- to 24 -- to a range of EUR 0.24 to EUR 0.25.
Now for additional information and to review what we've discussed, I'll refer to today's earnings presentation.
Now in conclusion, for the full year 2022, we reiterate our objectives for total and software revenue to grow 9% to 10% ex
FX, and we confidently raise our EPS target to reach now a 9% to 11% growth. We expect a solid second quarter, and we
look forward to keeping you appraised of our progress throughout the rest of the year.
And now I'll hand the call back over to Pascal.
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Thank you, Rouven. Just a few words to conclude this call, so -- and to summarize what we said.
So first, the world is transforming at an unprecedented pace and sustainability and resiliency are paramount. From a
sustainability perspective, it is clear that we walk the talk. Our new Life Cycle Assessment Solution is yet another proof
point. In term of resiliency, our clients face a number of challenges, from raw materials to workforce, supply chain and
inflation.
With the investment we have made a decade ago, clearly we are uniquely positioned to help our clients to solve those
challenges and to adopt new business model, increase agility, scale and embrace sustainability. This has created durable
competitive advantages across all the sectors of the economy.
So in conclusion, we had a solid start to the year, giving us confidence to raise our full year EPS target and putting us at a
good trajectory to achieve our near- and long-term objectives.
Finally, we will be hosting our Capital Market Day on June 16, and we look forward seeing you -- all of you in person in
Paris.
So now I think it's time for Bernard and Rouven to take your questions. Thank you.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL  APR 27, 2022

Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of James Goodman from Barclays.
James Arthur Goodman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
On BIOVIA, I recall that last quarter you talked about some multiyear renewals, I think, slipping. Just curious, when
were they signed in this period? And did that help the double-digit growth there? And can you say something about the
materiality of the deals and the underlying performance or what we should expect for the rest of the year in BIOVIA?
And secondly, on Industrial Innovation, encouraging performance in both CATIA and ENOVIA this period. I can't help but
wonder if there's anything worth calling out from your side on SIMULIA or DELMIA in terms of the rest of the performance
of that unit.
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Rouven, you want me to start?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
If you like, Pascal.
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Okay so let's say a few words about BIOVIA. So you're right last time that we communicated to you that we have not been
able to renew on time one of the large deal for BIOVIA. It has been done, in fact, the few weeks after the beginning of the
quarter. It's -- by the way, it's a large contract with a European company. When I say large, it's not EUR 10 million, it's a
few millions anyway.
What has been -- what we can notice on BIOVIA is the fact that the subscription is growing double digits. And you'll
remember one of the things we have to do with BIOVIA is to transition the license model to subscriptions, and I think we
are on the right path and it's really happening and taking off.
But more broadly speaking, I think in Life Sciences, it's not only MEDIDATA and BIOVIA, but we see more and more large
projects which are much more PLM centric, if you want, leveraging the rest of what we do, whatever (sic) [ whether ] it's
SIMULIA or DELMIA or ENOVIA for the life cycle management. And we have a significant, sizable deal in our pipelines
between now and the rest of the year.
So I think the trajectory for Life Sciences is really solid. And it's not only the performance of MEDIDATA, it's really
everything we do. And I should, to a certain extent, congratulate the team we have put in place under the leadership of
Michael Pray who is coming from MEDIDATA and is driving the sales force for the entire sector, I think. He's doing a great
job to make this happen.
Related to the Industrial Innovation sector, yes, you're right to notice that ENOVIA and CATIA are performing well both
from a license and subscription standpoint, which is echoing what I'm saying, guys, that be careful when you do the
statistics to measure the market share. You have to take into account the track record.
Now related to DELMIA and SIMULIA. DELMIA had a good quarter. SIMULIA, the growth was much more modest. But I
want you to keep in mind that last year, we grew significantly with DELMIA -- with, sorry, SIMULIA because we signed two
large deals in the auto sector and we have a real big comparison effect. So -- but we are pretty confident on the trajectory
for SIMULIA for the rest of the year.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11Your next question comes from the line of Frederic Boulan from Bank of America.
Frederic Emile Alfred Boulan
BofA Securities, Research Division
To stay on the topic of cloud, if you can give us an update on proportion of revenues or clients which are on, a,
subscription versus license; and b, cloud outside of MEDIDATA. You touched on that transition happening at SIMULIA,
but if you can give us an update on the other lines of products, whether that's from a takeup appetite from clients but also
takeup you're seeing. In that context, if we can come back on the license guidance for Q2, which is quite strong. So how
do we reconcile those two dynamics?
And then second, an update on M&A priorities. Any views you have around public versus private valuations, whether you
think it's an appropriate time. Considering that discrepancy that may still be around, is it a hurdle for you to press ahead?
And what are the priorities? I mean you called out this morning, I think, delivery on the infrastructure side as usual, I would
say. But if you can just give us an update on what you think are the most attractive opportunities for you.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Okay. So Frederic, thanks for the questions. I'll start with the first one around the cloud momentum and also how to
reconcile the license guidance for the second quarter.
So overall, as Pascal mentioned, 21% growth for cloud. Cloud represents now 21% of our total software revenue. And the
growth drivers on our cloud business, of course MEDIDATA's performance stands out. But the -- if I look at the portfolio in
total, we had also very good performance and strong growth across multiple parts of our portfolio.
For -- 3DEXPERIENCE is growing fast in the cloud. Certainly, we have a lot of newcomers that are adopting the cloud
first, using 3DEXPERIENCE at different levels of scale but also incumbents that are transitioning from on-premise to the
cloud with large projects.
And we see overall, the momentum for our subscription and recurring has accelerated through these growth drivers. But
also, we mentioned SIMULIA before. SIMULIA is a subscription business. It's consumption based that's driving lots of
subscription growth and part of it also in the cloud.
So that's to me the summary of the growth drivers that really is underpinning the 21% cloud growth that we have. And I
think we can go faster from there as well in the future.
And of course, the mainstream market remains our large opportunity. This is SOLIDWORKS' installed base to -- not only
transition to SOLIDWORKS but expand the usage in the SOLIDWORKS ultimately.
As it relates to our license objectives for the quarter -- and also, like the first quarter, I'll remind you we license 10% of
subscription, also growing double digit. So we are continuing with this trend into the second quarter.
We have a very good visibility into our second quarter pipeline, which is shaping since the beginning of this year. It's
broad based as we saw the contribution. As Pascal walked through the various growth drivers, it was a -- it's a pod-
based momentum across various industries and product segments that's supporting our Q2 license outlook. So that's the
situation.
Frederic Emile Alfred Boulan
BofA Securities, Research Division
CENTRIC PLM is also contributing?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Yes. CENTRIC PLM? Yes.
Related to the M&A question, Frederic, the M&A is part of our model, right? And it's not because we were leveraged
that we did -- we stopped completing the M&A. We were continuing to do some modest movements, I would say, but
nevertheless critical for the future.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL  APR 27, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12The thing you want -- I want you to keep in mind, we are purpose driven. And that's how we are guiding our M&A
investigation. It's not to fill the gap from a quarter to another one or to establish a footprint without taking the benefit of the
rest of what we do.
So why I'm saying this? Because you're right, I mean, by being close to be fully delevered -- deleveraged, sorry, and given
the market momentum in term of valuations, this is giving probably good conditions to consider transformational moves.
But it's not enough to have this market condition. You also need to have a vision, you also need to have a strategy and
you need also to have a team willing to join and do it with you. It's taking time, so do not expect me to share the M&A
priorities during this call. But I think we are working constantly to make it happen.
And the only thing I could say is we have opportunity to expand in all the three sectors of the economy. Always, you
are mentioning infrastructure and construction. It's definitively not the only one we consider to make a significant move
because we are far from covering everything we can do for all the industry we are serving. So that's what I can say at this
stage.

Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division
Regarding the -- hello, sorry about that. Sorry. You referred earlier in your remarks to your ambitious hiring plans for 2022.
This is a subject, of course, you've spoken of in earlier calls. So two questions there. It's interesting to observe that over
a period of many years, your sales openings and R&D openings have been often very similar. But recently, there's been
a particularly large uptrend in your sales openings as compared to R&D, so maybe you could talk about your thinking in
terms of this rather large increase in your sales openings in the last few months.
And then similarly, when we look at it by the product or functional area, there have been some recent increases in your
ambitions to hire in DELMIA, SIMULIA and cloud generally. So maybe you could comment on all of that.

So Jay, I think I know the way you compute the numbers is because you are looking all the research we are publishing
on our website. But be careful. Why so? Because if you look at the numbers, the total headcount increased by 7%. And in
research and development, we increased by 9%. So there is a piece you are not seeing because the way we hire people
is not by doing search, it's by doing computations between the people. And it's not visible from you.

The referrals.

That's usually the way we hire most of the research and development people.
So I would not draw these conclusions. If I -- if -- the balance between sales and, I would say, the field in general
compared to the research and development is relatively the same than what we used to do in the past.
The second question is related to DELMIA and SIMULIA. Yes, you're right, I think specifically in the United States, we see
more and more traction for these specialized brand sales, I would say. And we need to reinforce the expertise we have
not because we do not have it, it's because we need to have it at scale. And in all the industry we serve, which is, again,
something which is important, generally speaking we have a good footprint for the aerospace and the auto sectors and
Industrial Equipment. But now we are serving more and more...
Rouven Bergmann

The bioreactor.
Pascal Daloz

Yes, and the pharma and the biotechnology, the consumer goods and consumer packaged goods industry, and we need
to reinforce these capabilities. So you are right to mention that it's an area where we are looking for people. But again,
much more in North America than in the rest of the world.
Jay Vleeschhouwer
Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division
Okay. Duly noted. Secondly, with regard to segment profitability, once upon a time, the -- you used to disclose the
operating margin for the CATIA and SOLIDWORKS business. And I know that was many years ago, but presumably,
given the scale of those businesses, that each of those is still an over 40% operating margin business.
And the question then is, what are you seeing or what are you anticipating in terms of the profitability of other businesses,
particularly something like in ENOVIA where historically, PLM profitability has often lagged substantially the profitability of
the CAD business?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 14ENOVIA is at -- the standard for the group. So another way to see it, you take our operating margin and you can make the
assumption that ENOVIA is aligned with it.
The real improvement is coming from MEDIDATA from a brand standpoint. You'll remember when we acquired
MEDIDATA, the operating margin was relatively low compared to the rest of the product line. And the team did an
outstanding job to not only accelerate the growth, diversifying in many different product line outside of Rave, patient
-- MEDIDATA Patient Cloud, and MEDIDATA, yes, is a proof point of this. But also, they had improved significantly
the operational efficiency. The plan was to improve by 200 basis points per year. And to a certain extent, we are
overachieving this plan in the last 2 years.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes.
Jay Vleeschhouwer
Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division
Okay. And then to finish up, I'd like to ask about two recent so conferences. One, 3DEXPERIENCE World and then the
conference in New Orleans a couple of weeks ago.
So at 3DEXPERIENCE World, the company gave its annual priorities and objectives to the resellers, which is always
interesting. And one of the objectives for this year was double-digit growth. And the question is, is that still your thinking,
that you can have double-digit growth with the SOLIDWORKS business this year? And do you think that you might
perhaps exceed the expectation that 3DExperience WORKS specifically would be less than 10% of the businesses?
In other words, could you -- could 3DX WORKS perhaps do even better and become more than 1/10 of the WORKS
business?
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
So I will start with the first part of the question, and maybe, Bernard, if you could answer to the second one.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Yes.
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
So yes, the plan is to grow double digit for the SOLIDWORKS business at large. So it's not only the SOLIDWORKS
desktop, it's basically the entire family of SOLIDWORKS. And we have demonstrated Q1 that we were on track to make it
happen.
This growth, by the way, in Q1 for the mainstream market is really broad based across all the geos, and it's broad-based
also from an industry standpoint. Where we are seeing an acceleration is really in the Industrial Equipment, where we see
more and more investment in many parts of the region of the world. And SOLIDWORKS is really the first brand benefiting
from these large investments happening.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
The 3DEXPERIENCE WORKS family is aimed at paying the platform phenomenon around not only the SOLIDWORKS
users to expand, as you mentioned previously in the previous question, with simulation, for example project management,
program management or even DELMIAWORKS for -- which, by the way, is getting traction. It was a small -- very small
business when we bought it, if you remember IQMS, Jay. And we are now learning how to grow the partners to sell it.
Now it's not what we want it to be, but the potential is there. And many of the companies doing plastic injection and so on
are adopting DELMIAWORKS to do the ERP side of the functionality, the MES -- including MES, of course but also ERP
in certain countries, with simply ERP. And we don't, unfortunately, support all standards yet and all countries, languagesDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL  APR 27, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15and standards, but we are improving it. So we still -- this was a good move, and it will continue. So on the ERP side,
simple ERP, for small companies, analysis and simulation project management.
The intent is also, Jay, to leverage the 3DEXPERIENCE WORKS to provide native SOLIDWORKS, cloud-based browser-
based functionality. So no desktop but really mobile. And this is getting attention because it's really about truly mobility.
Not visual mobility for visualization, but mobility for design. And the traction that we have with 3DByMe, what we call
3DByMe, which is platform based, cloud based, browser based, is a good sign as well as the maker offer. The maker offer
is getting traction. And the numbers grow slowly because it's about less than [ 100 ] per year, right? But it's getting traction
on the number of users and also the adoption in terms of ease of the experience to adopt this mobility aspect. So that's
important for the future.
Jay Vleeschhouwer
Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division
Okay. By the way, if my high school algebra still works, it looks as though you did about 19,000 new SOLIDWORKS
commercial seats in Q1, which, if that's right, that would have been, I think, a Q1 record for new SOLIDWORKS seats.
In any case, just to finish up on the New Orleans conference, it was very interesting to hear DS management highlight
model-based systems engineering as one of your "big initiatives." And then also, you seem to be coming to market now
with generative design capabilities that you had first spoken of about 3 years ago. So maybe you could talk about what
you think the impact might be of one or both of those in terms of driving the Industrial Innovation business.
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Yes. Well, for -- generative design was widely adopted years ago, 15 years ago or 20 years ago, in the CATIA world. All
the advanced CATIA users are already doing generative design at scale. If you take the big companies, those are -- this is
why CATIA is winning everywhere in aerospace, on automotive.
So -- but making it mainstream, as you noticed, Jay, is a different game because it has to be simplified. But yes, you're
right, it's the tendency to go generative because this creates AI-based design guidelines for the users.
On the cyber system, we call it cyber system at large, not cybersecurity but cyber system, we believe this is so core
because most of the new little equipments are becoming integration between software, electronics and mechanical
systems: home equipment, med tech and many others. And more and more certification processes are required to
guarantee integrity.
And I will not go through the market structure, but, as you know, it has been very fragmented up to now. You had the
software development on one side, the tech development on the electronic board on one side, and then the mechanical
side, but there is no holistic integration of the total. Of course, for very smart, advanced system like [ GRONS ], this is
what we do. But those are for very specialized customers. But we think this will become mainstream. So 3DEXPERIENCE
cyber system, core for the future.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Amit Harchandani from Citi.
Amit B. Harchandani
Citigroup Inc., Research Division
Amit Harchandani from Citi. Two questions, if I may. My first question is on the topic of deal sizes. There sometimes
tends to be a perception that larger deal sizes are more at risk when macro begins to worsen. So I wanted to get
your perspective on how do the deal sizes in your business look today versus history because the rising talk of digital
transformation tends to also point to more end-to-end deals? So curious to understand, how are you seeing deal sizes
evolve across different segments, different industries as you shift to the cloud? And to what extent would you see them as
being at risk if the macroeconomic backdrop continues to worsen? So that would be my first question.
My second question goes to the topic of operating margin. You had a solid operational performance, as you indicated,
in Q1. And I was curious to better understand some of the underlying drivers. Was it sales efficiencies, cross-selling, up-
selling, simply better mix? And why does your guidance seem to suggest that not all of this strength in Q1 is going to carryDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL  APR 27, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16over, over the remaining 3 quarters? I appreciate some of the costs are coming back, but maybe you might benefit from
better prices as well. So keen to understand the operational strength in Q1. And how much of it is sustainable into the
coming quarters?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Okay. I will start with the deal size this time. It's a question requesting probably to spend the rest of the call. But
nevertheless, I was checking real time. If you compare the pipeline for 2020 to 2021, we have exactly the same mix in
term of large deals compared to last year after [indiscernible]. So there is no discrepancy between the natural trend we
are seeing.
Do we consider those deals at risk or not? I will say no. Why so? Because we are -- again, we are extremely diversified
from an industry standpoint. We're extremely diversified from a geo standpoint. And also, the vast majority of the large
deals we have are coming from long-standing customers we have. So they started their transformation a few years ago,
and now they are just saying they are making it happen.
So the only thing that could happen sometime is one of them being postponed from 1 quarter to another one. But I do not
consider I'm seeing the risk improving given the situations at the macro level right now.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Okay. And let me touch on the -- your question around the operating margin.
Yes, there is some -- part of the operating margin improvement is discretionary spend, simply lower spend as compared
to our plan simply because there are still parts of the world where there's much less business travel. Some of our events,
we talked about SOLIDWORKS user conference, for example. We did it as a hybrid virtual event versus initially it was
planned as an on-site event.
So you have these types of savings, which, I would say, account for about 60% of the margin improvement that we have
shown in the first quarter. The remaining part is -- really is coming from an improved service margin. I mentioned this in
my outline. We are improving the service margin by almost 400 basis points, that has an impact. As well as MEDIDATA,
which Pascal referred to earlier. The team did an excellent job in improving the margin while continuing to invest and build
the organization to drive the future growth. And the margin contribution from that business is exceeding our initial plans.
And some of it is recurring because the mix of resources certainly in the R&D function with the ability to recruit in India in
our development center really has a profound impact on the margin profile of MEDIDATA. Positive impact, yes, of course.
So that's what I would say. So about -- as I said, to summarize, 60% is discretionary items and 40% is in operating
improvement. Now for the -- if you look at it from an entire -- for the year, in our 60 basis points margin improvement that
we are updating our objectives for, that reflects the overperformance from Q1. We stick to our plan that we outlined at the
beginning of the year for the quarters Q2 to Q4, and that includes the hiring objectives that we set. We hired -- we grew
the headcount 7% for the total company, as we said. It's about 450 people in the quarter, net growth. And that plan is
continuing, and it's baked into the numbers. I hope that gives you some additional color.
Operator
Your final question comes from the line of Johannes Schaller from Deutsche Bank.
Johannes Schaller
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
I mean on the headcount cost side, hiring is obviously one driver. And the other is, I guess, like-for-like wage inflation. I
think if you talk to larger software peers, it feels like that. The expectation for like-for-like wage inflation has definitely gone
up over the last 3 or 6 months. And maybe even at some of your counterparts, there's a bit of a shift towards cash-based
and away from share-based compensation given where software share prices are right now.
I think -- can you maybe quantify for us what you expect in terms of like-for-like wage inflation for this year and then
maybe then also going into next year for your workforce? That would be helpful.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL  APR 27, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 17And then as a second point, I think you alluded to some price increases for some of your products. Can you maybe help
us understand that a bit better, how big the impact of that would be in the second half of the year?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Sorry, I -- can you repeat the second question quickly, Johannes? Sorry, I was...
Johannes Schaller
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Sorry, the second question was just on price increases. I think you alluded to...
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Oh, I thought you said product. Thank you, Johannes. Okay.
Johannes Schaller
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Yes.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
So I start with the -- your point around the wage inflation and like-for-like.
So we have factored in an average of 5% wage increase for the year across our workforce. I think the way you also have
to conceptualize and think is that in order to manage the inflation overall from a cost standpoint, it's also a question of
the mix of resources and our hiring strategy. I referred, for example, to MEDIDATA, where we are successfully offshoring
resources in parts of the world where we have better access to talent. That improves overall the mix of resource that gives
us flexibility. Those things you also have to factor in as we make structural improvements, right, to the overall mix.
Nevertheless, of course we are, as everyone else, competing for the best talent in the market. And therefore, we'll -- we
made this adjustment. But I think we have an attractive proposition.
From the perspective of inflation and how it is reflected into our pricing, the way we are -- we've instrumentalized or we've
operationalized the price adjustment with -- through our reseller and partner business, we are -- for our SOLIDWORKS
partners, for example, we have successfully implemented price adjustments in our CPI -- for all -- for renewable contracts,
we have CPI clauses that adjust for pricing based on consumer price index. So we are protected here.
But I think the key part of what's aligned with our strategy is at the end, when we have an opportunity to do transformation,
we are selling value, and that gives us an opportunity to price for value. And then we are discussing not inflationary price
increases, we are discussing price for value, which -- that's our strategy. And that's what we really -- what ultimately is
driving our growth forward within our installed base and in new customer wins.
Johannes Schaller
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Is there a way to put a number to the kind of value increase or price increases? And maybe combine that factor, how
much that is driving of -- your growth for this year?
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
The price increase is usually not exceeding the inflation, right...
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL  APR 27, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 18Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Because it's difficult to reflect more than that. And again, for the vast majority, it's happening in the middle of the year. So
you take the inflation globally, you divide by 2, and you have a good sense of what we are talking about.
With that, I would like to thank you -- everyone. It was great for us to be in London with a -- on a face-to-face this morning,
and it's really a good come-back together. We're looking for -- to see many of you in June.

Operator
Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Dassault Systèmes 2022 Q2 and First Half Earnings
Presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to
hand over to your speaker, Beatrix Martinez, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you, Katya. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2022 presentation. With me with us
today are Pascal Daloz, our Chief Executive Officer; and Rouven Bergmann, our Chief Financial Officer.
I remind you that Dassault Systèmes results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. Most of the financial figures
discussed on this conference call are on a non-IFRS basis, with revenue growth rates in constant currencies, unless
otherwise noted. For an understanding of the differences between the IFRS and non-IFRS, please see the reconciliation
tables included in our press release.
Some of our comments on this call contain forward-looking statements that could differ materially from actual results.
Please refer to today's press release and the Risk Factors section of our 2021 universal registration document. All
earnings materials are available on our website.
I would like now to hand over to Pascal Daloz.
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Thank you, Beatrix. Good morning to all of you. And again, thank you for joining us. It's really a pleasure to be with you
today. As you understood, Bernard will not be joining us for the second quarter announcement today. He was recently
presenting our Capital Market Day and attending our governance road show, which is, for the one who know him, unusual,
right? The last time he did it was at the time of the IPO. And it gave a rendezvous in the next 20 years so. But be sure he
will be back with us to share his vision and perspective on the industry for the future.
Let's start. I think we are pleased with the Q2 results. We delivered a strong second quarter and half year results, putting
us on the trajectory to achieve our 2022 objectives. Our good performance was driven by broad-based growth across
geographies, product lines and industry. And I think we have demonstrated once again the resilience of our strategy
against challenging macroeconomics and geopolitical backdrop with an impact from Russia and China.
For the second quarter 2022, total revenue grew organically 11%, with both subscriptions and support license up double
digits. The earnings per share increased 21% to EUR 0.26, outperforming our objectives, and we continue to support our
long-term growth initiative with the net count increase 8% overall and 10% in research and development specifically.
For our full year 2022 objective, we are reaffirming our revenue growth target of 9% to 10% at constant currency.
However, we are factoring in some volatility in license revenue driven by China. And we have also increased our EPS
objective to 14%, 16% growth from 9% to 11% previously. I think it is clear from our results that our clients continue to
invest in both to address the challenge posed by the current environment as well as to prepare for the future. And I think
our industry are considered being mission-critical for all of them.
So Rouven will discuss more the financial results in details after my quick presentation. Now I would like to share some
perspective on our strategy as well as to review our operating performance for Q2. If you remember, during our recent
Capital Market Day, we have a significant ambitions for our next horizon to 2040. As in the past, when we look at the
future, we begin to lay out the foundation for our success.
In 2012, you remember, we unveiled our vision for the experience economy and shift from product to experiences. You
have seen this validated with the transition to sustainable mobility experience, for example. We have also introduced our
3DEXPERIENCE platform to start preparing them to support our clients with a differentiated technology today.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 26, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 5In 2020, following the MEDIDATA acquisition, we repositioned the company, along the 3 sectors of the economy,
Manufacturing Industries, Life Sciences & Healthcare and Infrastructure & Cities. And we also announced our extensions
to the virtual twin from things to life.
In 2022, we are introducing the circularity concept within our 3DEXPERIENCE platform. We call it the IFWE Loop. It
represents really a true paradigm shift in our strategy. Now, why now? I think the experience economy and the circular
economy are really converging, and this will mark the coming decades.
As we look our next horizon to 2040, industry will no longer develop products, but sustainable experience centered
around the consumer patients and citizens. And the experience economy goes hand by hand with circularity as it requires
designing the entire life cycle experience upstream, integrating the use with the hand of life. I think circularity is also about
frugality, using only what's necessary and appreciating all the things created by the humankind will have to hand. The raw
materials that compose then can be repurposed, reused and recycled. And I think this will revolutionize design and open
up significant new opportunity we cannot yet imagine.
Now if you look at our 3DEXPERIENCE, if we look, it connects value creations with value experience to cover the full
experience life cycle. This allow innovator to anticipate the recycling of the product from their design and manufacturing
to quantify the environment impact and optimize the circularity. As a consequence, our 3DEXPERIENCE platform is not
only a way to be game changer and to displace the competitive landscape, but it's also a multiplier, a multiplier to expand
our value proposal from linear to circular economy, converging sustainability and experience economy. And a multiplier
to expand the audience by connecting people, data and IDs from industry professionals to all business communities and
ultimately, the consumer, the patient and the citizens. And this will be our next frontier.
Now let's see our industry solutions are evolving to provide an accurate assessment of the environment footprint. Please
launch the video.
[Presentation]
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Now we have been talking about the next 20 years. Let's come back on how we are helping the clients in the present. In
today's challenging environment, from inflation to raw material shortage and meeting sustainability imperatives, I think
we are rebuilding the value and the mission-critical nature of our industry solutions. And I think we are seeing a strong
customer adoptions in this quarter across all the 3 sectors of the economy, and it offer many proof points. So let's look at
few example.
In the consumer industry, we are expanding our value proposal to new audiences, reaching the business community I
was mentioning previously. With the virtual twin experience at the means of operations, we are helping retailers increase
efficiency, resiliency and mix sustainability imperatives. This quarter, for example, we have established a new partnership
with Asda, one of the Britain's largest retailers, serving 18 million people and 98% of the U.K. homes every week. And
Asda has chosen to utilize DELMIA Quintiq to rethink the entire value network, to increase operational efficiency, savings
millions, to capitalize on those efficiency gains to offset inflation and lower consumer prices, improve the customer
experience with the last-mile delivery and to advance sustainability goals by reducing the empty mileage. I think we are
extremely pleased to support Asda, and we will continue to build upon its significant legacy.
If we zoom in life sciences, we have been pioneering incredible innovations during the last decades, challenging the
game for our clients. And MEDIDATA is by far the #1 trusted partner and the gold standard in clinical trials. Without our
investments, we will not have electronic data capture as the standard for all the clinical trials with decentralized trials
becoming the new best practices. We will not have the synthetic control hub as a groundbreaking way to speed up
evidence generation and time to market.
Without these innovations, our clients would not have been able to develop the COVID vaccine in record time. But the
pandemic exposed many vulnerability within the industry. Remember, it took only 1 year to develop the vaccine, but it took
more than 2 years to manufacture it at scale. So this industry was not really capable to producing different therapeutics in
a short time of reasons. Addressing these issues is really becoming a must and will require significant reconfiguration and
investment.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 26, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 6And this quarter, we are expanding our long-standing partnership with Sanofi. Sanofi has decided to adopt the
3DEXPERIENCE platform as well as the Made To Cure for biopharma solutions to enable them to develop a modular and
more flexible manufacturing capabilities. Our technology will help Sanofi to develop and deliver vaccine at the pandemic
speed, which is really something becoming a need for many of our customers. It also accelerates the new facility and drug
launches, enabling the productions to multiple vaccine concurrently. And in addition, Sanofi will leverage our technology to
reduce water consumption, supporting its net zero carbon objectives.
We look forward to continuing to support Sanofi effort to improve patient outcomes. And I think only Dassault Systèmes
has the innovations, the technology and the scale to provide life sciences sector hand-to-hand solutions. We hope this
work with Sanofi serve as a catalyst to accelerate industry adoptions for all the manufacturing things we do and advance
the patient journey.
Now if we turn to Transportation & Mobility. There is a rapid transformation to sustainable mobility experience underway,
requiring a tremendous amount of science across many disciplines. And once again, I think it's something only Dassault
Systèmes can provide. Hopium, with a H, right, is a start-up founded by professional car racers, has designed an
innovative fuel cell and transform air and hydrogen into energy emitting nothing but water, while at the same time
reaching a speed of 230 kilometers per hour, which is almost a sport car performance, right, traveling for more than 1,000
kilometers, similar to a long-haul truck and refilling less than in 3 minutes, which is far less than your phone. So I think
combining the challenge is requesting a lot of science to make it happen. And Hopium has deployed the 3DEXPERIENCE
platform solution on the cloud and created its first prototype in only 8 months.
I think this example are a testimony of the mission-critical nature of our industry solutions in addressing resiliency,
sustainability as well as the value we bring to our relationships.
Now shifting gears, let's turn to the review of our operational performance. Starting with the revenue by geographies. The
Americas grew 8% during this quarter, driven by a strong performance in subscriptions. And from an industry perspective,
Life Sciences and Industrial Equipment were key contributors to performance. Europe accelerated to 13% growth in Q2,
and performance was really broad-based. Northern Europe, France, Southern of Europe delivered an excellent result
driven by Transportation & Mobility and Aerospace.
Asia Pacific rose 13% this quarter, showing strong resilience in the face of the China COVID-19 restrictions. And we were
expecting lockdown to last a few weeks, but instead, they have been lasted months. Nevertheless, I think we have been
able to largely offset this with Japan, south of Asia Pacific, India growing double digits, and China grew low single digits as
well.
Now zooming on the performance in the product line. Industrial Innovation software revenue rose 11%. And again, this
performance was really broad-based across multiple brands, having CATIA, ENOVIA, DELMIA as well as NETVIBES
growing double digits. And to be noticed, because for CATIA growing double digits is not an easy thing, it means that
all the new specialized products we have related to CATIA Cyber Systems, the one used to design the architecture and
the connected things, are demonstrating an excellent performance against this quarter, reflecting really the differentiated
value of our technologies.
DELMIA to be noticed also. DELMIA benefited from a strong interest in manufacturing transportations as -- transformation,
sorry, as clients seeks to increase efficiency, resiliency and connect operation with a platform approach.
Resuming Life Sciences, revenue grew 13%. And I think MEDIDATA maintained the velocity, growing 15% and on
the back of a high comparison base, if you remember. MEDIDATA continues to experience strong momentum across
its product portfolio, including MEDIDATA Rave, MEDIDATA AI and MEDIDATA Patient Cloud, as well as across end
markets, including pharmaceutical, biotechno and contract research organizations. MEDIDATA also experienced a good
traction in medical devices and in the mid-market in Europe, which, if you remember, was one of the point of synergy of
the merger with MEDIDATA and Dassault Systèmes. And I think this quarter is demonstrating also the durability of the
MEDIDATA growth profile.
To be noticed also, our life science engagement, which is the dedicated channel we have to serve the life science sectors,
continue to gain also 3DEXPERIENCE platform reference wins, Sanofi being one of them.
Moving to the Mainstream Innovation software. Revenue increased 8%. And I think SOLIDWORKS grew mid-single digit
against a strong baseline effect of 25% growth last year. And SOLIDWORKS was really the product line being impactedDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 26, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7by the China COVID-19 restrictions, which have lasted longer than expected. I think we view this as transitory issues. And
when the situation normalize, we expect a return to trend line growth, which is between 8% to 9%.
Centric PLM continue to experience strong momentum with revenue increase high double digits. But to be noticed also
that Centric PLM accelerated innovation and time to market by improving the quality and the optimizations. And this
is mission-critical for many consumer companies. And looking forward, we have a significant opportunity to leverage
Centric's strong momentum by reaching new audiences and providing new value proposal. Centric PLM started in the
domain of fashion and retail, and we are now expanding in new industries such as food and beverage, cosmetics and
personal care.
Centric clients were also primarily large international brands. While today, the company is having a good success with
retailers and SMBs. And additionally, the strategy is really to expand Centric value proposal beyond the collection
management to business planning and analytics as well as e-commerce. So ultimately, there are a number of vectors for
growth to continue to drive the expansion for Centric PLM well into the future.
Speaking about continuing to invest in innovations for the benefit of our customers, whatever is organically or through
acquisitions. I'm pleased to announce a small acquisition, but very emblematic and maybe you can launch the video. It's
a French-based start-up, leading players in the V+R on the shop floor and in the field complement our DELMIA offering
and accelerate the expansion into quality control compliances and work instructions. The name of the company is Diota.
it combines an advanced 3D interactive capabilities with augmented reality and AI technology. And it complements data-
centric approach, incorporating the real-world dividends coming from machines, the shop floor or also from the field
equipment.
This company solution utilize virtual technology in the field, a kind of metaverse if you want. And you remember, the
metaverse is maybe a new concept for the industry, but it's something we started a long time ago. And this specific case
is used to maximize the traceability and the productivity throughout the complex manufacturing, inspections, certification
and maintenance processes. It's a small start-up, EUR 2 million revenue. But I think Diota offer a proven technology, a
great team and an impressive customer roster also. So I think we are delighted to have Diota joining us, and we welcome
the team on board.
I think now it's time for me to hand over the presentation over to Rouven to discuss the financial performance and 2022
objectives. Rouven, you have the floor.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Thank you, Pascal, and hello, everyone. It's great to speak to you today. As you heard from Pascal, we had an excellent
second quarter across the board. This demonstrates the strength and the durability of our business model. It also gives
us the confidence to reaffirm our 2022 objectives for the year. While at the same time, we are acknowledging some
macroeconomic uncertainty.
In the second quarter, we delivered on the key initiatives we communicated to you during our Capital Market Day. We
saw an acceleration in recurring revenue growth to double digits, driving overall software revenue growth to 11% and we
delivered strong earnings growth with EPS up over 20%, well supported by 32% operating margin in the middle of our
targeted range.
Now let's take a closer look at the proof points with a review of our Q2 non-IFRS results. Total revenue grew 11% year-
over-year, EUR 15 million above the midpoint of our guidance. This was driven by accelerating recurring revenue growth
of 10%, above the high end of our guidance. Recurring revenue represented 78% of software revenue during the period.
License revenue increased solid double digits at 14% this quarter. The license growth, as you heard from Pascal, was
negatively impacted by China's COVID-19 restrictions.
Coming into the quarter, we expected this to last up to a few weeks. However, the lockdown lasted over 2 months and
it attributed about 3 percentage points of headwind to the license growth in the quarter. Despite this, we delivered a
good performance and again, highlighting the resiliency of our model. Contributing to the overall strong momentum, our
services revenue rose 14%, also above the targeted corridor.
Now let me comment on our business model evolution as reflected in 3DEXPERIENCE and cloud growth. A growing
list of customers, both new entrants and incumbents, are expanding their relationships with Dassault Systèmes.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 26, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 83DEXPERIENCE and cloud are critical for enabling resiliency and for helping clients to scale rapidly as they capitalize
on the benefits of adopting all our domains. We continue to see very good 3DEXPERIENCE momentum with revenue
growing 30% year-over-year to a share of 33% of software revenue, an increase of 4 points relative to last year.
Cloud revenue rose 23%, driven by continued strength in Life Sciences and 3DEXPERIENCE, Cloud now accounts for
22% of software revenue, up over 2 points versus last year, as we see large customers in our core industries such as
Aero & Defense, Transportation & Mobility and Industrial Equipment deploying 3DEXPERIENCE cloud solutions.
Let's discuss our operating margin performance versus objectives. We reported an operating margin of 32%, in the center
of our targeted range. And when factoring in the overachievement in revenue, the net impact of higher expenses versus
guidance was only 10 basis points. Relative to last year, expenses were up 12% and this reflects our confidence to
continue to invest in our long-term growth strategy. Indeed, we hired over 1,200 people during the quarter, representing
more than 420 net new team members. We grew head count by 8% overall and 10% within R&D versus last year.
These investments will allow us to further expand our reach and capabilities from managing transactions to driving
transformation when we lead with the 3DEXPERIENCE platform with our customers. We also saw more active travel and
marketing activity compared to a lower 2021 base, which accounted for about 20% of the increase. So as you can see, we
are investing in growth, our subscription and cloud revenue are growing at the highest rate, and we are not compromising
our profitability.
Now turning to EPS. For the second quarter, we delivered strong earnings per share growth of 21% to EUR 0.26 as
reported, above the objective range of 11% to 16%. The growth in EPS benefited this quarter from a more favorable FX
conversion, driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus euro with an impact of EUR 0.011, a higher operating
income contributing EUR 0.2 and a lower tax rate contributing EUR 0.2.
Let me briefly comment on the non-IFRS tax rate for the quarter of 20.8% versus our guidance of 21.2%, highlighting that
we continue to benefit from higher FDII tax deductions in the U.S. I'd also like to comment briefly on the reconciliation to
IFRS EPS. As you know, at the end of May this year, the long-standing tax dispute covering the fiscal years of 2008 to
2013 was concluded by the ruling of the French High Court, resulting in a onetime tax charge of EUR 145 million. There
was no cash impact this quarter, and there will be no cash impact in 2022 as all payments were made between the years
2014 and 2020. This dispute has been reported in our financial statements since 2014 as pending and is now closed.
Turning now to cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash and cash equivalents totaled EUR 3.157 billion compared to
EUR 2.979 billion at the end of last year, an increase of EUR 178 million. Our net financial debt ended June 30, 2022
decreased by EUR 405 million to now EUR 485 million compared to EUR 889 million at December 31, 2021. This puts us
well ahead of the schedule on our deleveraging objective.
Now let me provide some additional color on what's driving our cash position this quarter. First, cash from operations
totaled EUR 1.048 billion for the first 6 months, an increase of 1% relative to last year on the back of a strong comparison
base. Last year was up 21%. And now just looking at Q2, operating cash flow was up a strong 7% year-over-year. This
quarter, cash from operations was used for treasury stock repurchases of EUR 75 million, contributing to EUR 378 million
for the first 6 months, and we paid the dividend to our shareholders of EUR 224 million. Lastly, we had a benefit of EUR
116 million from FX with EUR 90 million coming from Q2 only.
Now let me transition to some key drivers of the second quarter operating cash flow performance. Net income adjusted
for noncash items is up 32%. The increase in contract liability reflects our business activity in line with recurring revenue
growth of 10%. The decreased income tax payable is driven by higher tax payments in the U.S. related to the mandatory
capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes only. Consequently, the deductibility of these expenses will be delayed,
resulting in an increase of cash taxes we pay.
And then lastly, the decrease in accrued compensation is due to lower social charges on stock-based compensation from
a lower share price in Q2 2022 versus the same period of last year.
Now let's turn to our fiscal year 2022 objectives. As we look to the remainder of the year, we feel optimistic about
our business momentum. At the same time, we are mindful of the macroeconomic backdrop characterized by mixed
sentiments. In this context, it's important to highlight that within our full year objectives, we already offset the revenue
impact from the wind down of operations in Russia, which accounts for about EUR 21 million of revenue for the year. This,
we discussed in Q1.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 26, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9Taking all that into account, we are reaffirming our 2022 total revenue growth objective of 9% to 10% growth, now to
a higher absolute range of EUR 5.485 billion to EUR 5.535 billion versus previously EUR 5.355 billion to EUR 5.405
billion previously. And this incorporates an update to the U.S. dollar rate from 1.14 to 1.10 for the remainder of 2022. This
adjustment to our currency assumption, along with the second quarter FX benefit, has a EUR 123 million positive impact
on our total revenue objectives.
Now in addition, we are also reflecting half of the Q2 overperformance and the remainder has contributed to derisk the
rest of the year, marked by an increasing uncertainty, more specifically in China, as also Pascal alluded to. We are
reflecting this adjustment mainly in the outlook in license growth, which is now projected to grow at 9% to 11% for the full
year.
Now let me turn to the operating margin. We are reconfirming our full year operating margin objective of 33.4% to 33.7%
and this reflects our continued commitment to invest in our long-term growth initiatives, including maintaining momentum
and achieving our hiring targets.
Turning now to EPS. We are raising our 2022 diluted EPS objective to 14% to 16% growth as reported, reaching EUR
1.08 to EUR 1.10. This compares to 9% to 11% growth previously, which was EUR 1.04 to EUR 1.06 previously. The
delta versus our previous target is driven by a EUR 0.026 FX benefit, EUR 0.004 revenue impact offset by EUR 0.007
from an increase in operating expenditures and a EUR 0.021 benefit from a lower tax rate. The updated tax rate reflects
higher FDII tax deduction for the second half of the year in the U.S. and a lower tax rate in France, each contributing at
similar weight.
Now let's review our 2022 objectives by revenue type. Software revenue growth is reaffirmed at 9% to 10%. Recurring
revenue growth is reaffirmed at around 9%. And as mentioned, the licenses and other software revenue growth is now 9%
to 11% from 10% to 12% previously for the reasons I outlined. Services revenue is targeted at 8% to 10% growth.
Now before closing, let me briefly also share our objectives for the third quarter. Total revenue and software revenue
growth of 8% to 10% with recurring revenue at approximately 9%, license revenue in the range of 6% to 10%, and service
revenues up 11% to 13%. The operating margin of 31.1% to 31.8% and diluted EPS growth of 6% to 11% to EUR 0.24 for
-- to the range of EUR 0.24 to EUR 0.25.
So let me now conclude. In conclusion, for the full year 2022, we reaffirm our growth objectives for total and software
revenue of 9% to 10%, ex FX, driven by good momentum in subscription and cloud revenue growth. We have raised our
outlook for total revenue, reflecting half of the Q2 overperformance in our full year objective and at the same time, derisk
some of the macro factors, specifically adjusting the license growth attributed to China.
Finally, we raised our EPS target to reach now 14% to 16% growth. We expect a solid third quarter, and we look forward
to keeping you informed as we progress through the second half of the year. And now Pascal, back to you.
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Thank you, Rouven, for sharing with us the guidance for the full year. So you have seen the level of confidence we have.
And I think if we step back a little bit, what could we say? We can say that our clients continue to invest in innovations to
both address today current challenges they have as well as to prepare the future. Resiliency and sustainability are really
the top priorities. And for all of them, what we do, our industry solutions are mission-critical.
The good thing is we know we have significant and durable competitive advantages to leverage each of the 3 sectors of
the economy we serve. And I think it has been described and highlighted in the visions we shared with you during the
Capital Market Day, the 2040 vision. I think you noticed that we have the foundation for the success.
And finally, I think I should thank our clients for their continued -- for their trust. It's a long-standing trust. We have been
over the time with them. And also for the team, our teams, for the patience because they are working hardly, and they
have a lot of dedication to our success.
Before to conclude, I want to say a few words. As you may know, we are a long-term company and usually we plan a little
bit in advance. So I want to take the opportunity to congratulate both François-José on his retirement, even if it will be next
year, right? And Beatrix Martinez for -- on her promotions to now lead our Investor Relations efforts.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 26, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10I think François, over the last 13 years, you have shaped the Investor Relations effort with tremendous integrity, I think,
always maintaining the investor trust as your north star. And I think you've done it with kindness, humor and a lot of
discipline, a military discipline, I should say. And it was truly an honor and a pleasure to working with you. And thanks
again for the leadership, the hard work and dedication to the IR team.
Beatrice (sic) [ Beatrix ], no need to welcome you on board. I think you joined or you joined Dassault Systèmes a long time
ago. And I think you and François have been working together for several years. We are lucky to have you leading the
Investor Relations and no doubt, you will carry out the torch extremely well. So I think now Rouven and I will be happy to
take your questions.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 26, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We are going to proceed with the first question. And the question comes from the line of Adam
Wood from Morgan Stanley.
Adam Dennis Wood
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
I've got two, please. The first one, I hear the confidence on a macro and well, rather, your business position in the macro.
I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about the environment. I think that's the question I get most from investors. I guess
the auto supply chain, SOLIDWORKS, maybe Germany, given the situation in Europe is where people would naturally
have concerns. Could you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in those areas and whether you've seen any signs
of sales cycles lengthening?
And then maybe secondly, we're in a, I suppose, a kind of a strange environment that you want to invest. There's probably
some catch-up from last year to do on that side of things. But we do face the challenges of a slowing economy. Could you
just talk a little bit about what the plans are for the second half of the year? Because that's the base you're going to be
then working from in 2023. In terms of costs, are you planning to invest [ totally as ] normally? Is there any kind of caution
that you have to prepare for a slower macro?
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Okay. Rouven, I take the first part of the question, and you will address the second one.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes, yes.
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
So if we look at by sectors, I think you noticed the Aerospace & Defense cycle is going extremely well. Last week, we had
a chance to attend the Farnborough exhibition, which is the U.K. air show, and we met a lot of customers. And what we
can see is the cycle was driven by the defense and space, and we see also the commercial being back. So I think -- and
it's not only true for the OEMs, but also for the supply chain.
So I think we have relatively good visibility for this sector. The Life Science sector, which is the second largest sector for
us, is also -- I will not say completely muted, but not subject to the macro environment. And again, there is so much this
industry needs to do to improve the efficiency, to also introduce new innovation that clearly the perspective are really
good.
Related to the auto sector, I think something happened. This industry is having a lot of shortage. And we -- this is true, we
are seeing some -- the volume dropping. But at the same time, we have seen the price increasing significantly on the new
vehicles. So why it's important? Because it's a way for many of our OEMs to restore their margin and continue to invest
in order to transition the entire product range to electrification and the autonomous car. And this is extremely important
because, as you may know, the regulation is really imposing it to happen in many regions of the world. And it's something,
any way, many of the OEMs need to do and accelerate.
So we do not see this activity slowing down. This is also true for the Tier 1 suppliers. Maybe for the Tier 2, Tier 3, there
are some effects, but it's probably still a little bit early for us to see it, right?
As far as the industrial equipment market is concerned, and as you may know, it's really the largest market for
SOLIDWORKS. Clearly, I confirm what Rouven say. It's going relatively well. I mean, the momentum is good, whatever
it's Europe or North America and in Asia. The only backdrop we have is really the one we have seen coming from China
because the lockdown was hurting earth. I mean the resellers, in a way, they were able to visit their customers. At theDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 26, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12same time, right now, you do not have too much measure to help them. I mean, the government, the Chinese government
is not helping too much this economy.
And for many small company restarting the activities is consuming a lot of the efforts and investments. And that's the
reason why we saw some softness for the Q2. But again, the perspective are relatively good for what we can see. And
for the consumer industry at large, whatever it's Centric PLM or what we do in the consumer packaged goods, again, the
cycle is extremely high. I mean, Centric is growing high double digits, and we continue to expand. That's what I can say.
Maybe for the cost, Rouven?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes, yes. Thank you, Adam. So for a few things that we've been considering as we thought about the second half of
the year and coming into next year, but I also want to come back to what we've presented at our Capital Markets Day
because this, for us, was an important point to reinsure and reconfirm some of our operating principles and the way we
run our business and prioritize our decisions. One of the key highlights was we shared with you the track record of us over
a decade, from 2012 to 2021, improve our margin by 40 basis points on average per year.
Now there can be fluctuations from year to year, but when you look at it at the macro picture, we have a strong track
record of continuous margin improvement. But at the same point of time, in 2022, when we issued our guidance, we said
we are going to catch up and we are going to make dedicated investments for some of the delays that we were facing in
2021. And that's what we are doing right now. We've been delivering on our plan for hiring and we plan to -- we stick to
our plan for the second half of the year to continue to invest into hiring the required capacity and the critical know-how that
will be important for us to continue our growth path in 2023 and beyond.
You saw 3DEXPERIENCE growing at 30%. You saw cloud growing at 23%. You heard from Pascal that more and more
of our customer engaging -- customer engagements are very strategic and driven by platform investments. They are
required to have deep knowledge about our customers' business processes and work with them long term together. And
that's where we are going to drive our growth and opportunity from across our sectors.
When we step back and the way we have -- now we have set our target for 2024, right? We are -- we have the room
right now to make these investments because we are on track. And we don't want to compromise that. And so that's, in a
nutshell, what we are -- what we look at in 2022. We took the cautious measure to trim the license outlook by 100 basis
points. Because of the good performance in the first half of the year, we can derisk. But we also reflected half of it already
in our guidance.
So I think it's a good balance and mix on the one side of investments and growth that we are confident about. I hope this
helps you to frame the outlook and the decisions that we have.
Operator
We are going to take the next question. The next question comes from the line of Kathinka de Kuyper from JPMorgan.
Kathinka M. de Kuyper
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Also two for me, please. Just on the situation of hiring. I think Q1, you mentioned you saw a 5% wage inflation. Is that still
the case or is it higher? And do you see the attrition rates improving? And then to what extent have you been able to pass
that wage inflation onto your customers, like price increases?
And then secondly, on the 3DEXPERIENCE software revenues. It was a nice acceleration to 30%. Can you provide a bit
more color on what was driving this acceleration, maybe what type of industries or type of customer? .
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Take the first one?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VPDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 26, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 13Yes, happy to. So yes, on the wage inflation that we communicated of percent, yes, that's factored into our Q2 actuals
because of the increase in salaries and compensation becomes effective 1st of April. So you see that reflected now for the
first 3 months. We had an OpEx increase overall, as you can see, from the materials we shared with you this morning of
12% OpEx increase. That's about EUR 100 million of increase year-over-year. About 70% of that increase is from payroll,
which reflects the 8% head count growth plus the compensation increase. So that is according to plan.
Of course, we monitor -- we continue to monitor the inflation situation as well as in comparison to the compensation to see
where we might be exposed because as many companies, we have faced attrition at higher rates and higher levels. While
at the same point, right now, we see that coming down, right? The attrition rates are declining because I think there is --
we've gone -- we've reached the peak level, and now we're seeing this coming slightly down. And we'll have to see how
the second half of the year will be. But I think we're starting to come down to more normal territory, right, where we used
to be. We're not there yet, but we've reached the peak levels.
From a pricing perspective, we have taken a lot of effort and focus at the beginning of the year and end of last year to do
all the preparation to be ready to implement price increases through our partner channel as well as through all our direct
business. We have executed some of it already at the end of Q1. There are still some price increases that are following in
the second quarter. We continue to monitor, of course, the rates. Every time we renew, we adjust for our consumer price
index or CPI index. That's business as usual. We are protected as it relates to that. But it's a topic that's top of mind for
us to ensure that we develop our price points according to the market prices, reflecting inflation as well as the value we
provide to our customers. Maybe to the 3DEXPERIENCE?
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Yes, you are right to notice that the 3DEXPERIENCE platform related software have grown 3x faster than the overall
revenue. It's not coming from one specific industry. It's really broad based, which is extremely important for us. From a
product line standpoint, I would say CATIA, ENOVIA, NETVIBES are really the one driving most of the growth. And it's
specifically coming from the direct large accounts we have against -- you have a piece coming from the indirect channel
as well. But the vast majority is really driven by the large contract we signed in Q2 and also Q1, where we had some
follow-ups.
So clearly, this is the profile of the 3DEXPERIENCE platform related software growth. And the way to conclude it is really
becoming mainstream. I mean it's the foundation in all the large contracts and all the large engagement we have. More
and more, the supply chain is adopting the 3DEXPERIENCE platform. And we see also the WORKS family taking off.
For example, this quarter, we had a good momentum with DELMIAWORKS, which as you remember, the expansion
of the manufacturing domains into the SOLIDWORKS installed base. And we are obviously -- it's part of the WORKS
family. So the 3DEXPERIENCE platform is really the cornerstone for -- to make it happen. That's what we can say for the
3DEXPERIENCE platform.
Operator
We are going to take the next question. And the next questions come from the line of Michael Briest from UBS.
Michael Briest
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Two for me as well. If you could just address the M&A pipeline. And I'm curious, with the big move in the U.S. dollar,
whether that has an effect on your ability or willingness to do U.S. deals at the moment.
And then, Rouven, on the services business, I mean, the guidance is 11% to 13% growth this quarter. I think it was 17% in
H1. But it looks like you're expecting a big slowdown in Q4. Can you talk of how that is and whether that business should
reaccelerate in 2023?
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Thank you, Michael, for the question. I will start with the first one, and Rouven will address the second one. So you are.
I mean, you are speaking about the M&A, but let's -- before to touch it. Just to reinforce that most of the growth we are
doing for the last 3 years, right, is an organic growth. And to be noticed that we are outperforming, putting the engine on
fire and pushing all the different cost [ levers ] we have. Nevertheless, it does not mean we will not consider M&A. AndDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 26, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 14you remember, I've been explicit about this. To complement the good quality of -- in terms of executions, we want also to
use the external growth lever.
And being deleverage almost, we are below EUR 0.5 billion net debt right now. And within a quarter, we will be positive.
So I think it's really the time to reconsider. We have a pipeline, right? And you are right, the dollar exchange rate is, to
some extent, helping. However, to make those kind of deals and transactions, you know the strategy should be well in
place. The team should be embark, and we should have the strategic framework being well designed. So clearly, we are
working on some of the projects.
The question maybe you have, is it something you could expect to have this year? Probably not, right? But is it something
you could expect in the future? Definitively yes. That's my way of answering, Michael.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Okay. Yes, thank you, Michael. I would say good catch on the services line. We have good momentum in the first half
of the year. You're right. It's obvious the numbers are very, very good, Q1 and Q2 even better. And we also have a solid
pipeline for the third quarter. We took the decision to not change the guidance for the year essentially because it's always
part of our strategy, is to make sure we enable and equip the ecosystem to really drive the weight of the implementation
and ensure they are skilled and trained because that's where the scale should be coming from.
We need to ensure that we drive the new innovation and the adoption and these are clue and be the domain -- those who
have the strong domain knowledge, but we really want to make sure and we -- in some way is reflected in this number that
we will rely more and more on the ecosystem and try to rely more on the ecosystem to take more of the growth. And while
we are making investments and recruiting consultants, we don't want to deprioritize that, right? We know it's critical. And
you see we have delivered strong growth, and the margin at the same time also have improved very nicely. The services
margin now at a healthy level of 13% to 14%. So that's the strategy we have.
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Just to complement what you say, Rouven. Michael, in almost in 25% of the large engagement we have, we are doing
jointly with CSI, and we want to improve from 25% to 50%. So that's really the goal. And Rouven say explicitly because
it's a way, really, to spread the skills and the competence through the ecosystems. And also if you remember, we were
protecting our capacity during the tough time, which was not the case for the CSI. So I think it's also important for them
to rebuild their capacity and giving more of the services businesses to them. It's also a way to help them to rebuild the
capacity in a short period of time.
Operator
We are going to take the next question. The next questions come from the line of Mohammed Moawalla from Goldman
Sachs.
Mohammed Essaji Moawalla
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
Great. Pascal and Rouven, two for me. First one, just focusing on the MEDIDATA side. You talked about the kind of
relative resiliency here, but also the growth opportunities. So maybe just curious to understand the kind of cross-sell,
upsell and uplifts you see on renewals and how sustainable that would be or how resilient that can be in perhaps a more
cautious macro environment. And then related to that is, again, the Life Sciences growth resiliency.
The second question is just on some of the strategic engagements that you've had. How do you -- or do you see any
impact on those discussions going forward? Perhaps kind of larger deals, are you seeing any changes in sort of customer
behavior around that for the kind of core manufacturing business? And how big of a risk do you see perhaps in next year
around that compared to kind of prior downturns where perhaps we did see customers dialing a lot of that spend back?
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Will you take the first one, Rouven?DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 26, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes, happy to. Thanks, Mo. Let's maybe give a little bit of more insight into the performance of MEDIDATA in the first 6
months of this year, and Q2 was certainly a strong quarter for MEDIDATA. It was actually Q2 was the largest bookings
performance of the company outside Q4, right? Q4 traditionally is the largest quarter of the year, but there was no -- never
a quarter outside of Q4 stronger than this Q2 in terms of incremental bookings performance. So I think it's -- it shows the
strength of the positioning and the, really, ability to continue to drive value and growth from our customers.
And how are we doing this? Because that's what's behind your question, right? When we look at upsell and cross-sell, it's
the DNA of the company, to do the value wide and value up, the land and expand and attach more products to existing
customers. And we do this typically at the time of renewals. And here, you ask for the upsell and cross-sell uplift that
we were able to achieve, which is at a level that's very, very good this quarter. I would say over 30% for every deal that
renewed on an annual contract value, we were able to increase the value and the contract value from customers at the
time of renewal compared to the prior contract that was in place.
So it shows the ability for us to attach more product, to create more value. And this is where the long-term investment
strategy is paying off because what are our clients doing? They are looking for our data management platform, right, to
be extended to patients with the Patient Cloud platform to really decentralize the infrastructure and the ability to engage
patients into clinical trials much more directly and seamlessly when they are at home, as well as using the AI capabilities
and our huge data assets to provide unique insights.
And now we top this with the 3DEXPERIENCE platform and the manufacturing capabilities to really change the paradigm
of life sciences overall, not only in drug development, but also in manufacturing and supply chain management. And this
is the example of Sanofi, which Pascal shared. And this is the starting point, and we have many active discussions where
these are relevant topics. So I would characterize it to summarize that the MEDIDATA performance is very durable. We
are kind of tailing off the COVID period. And I remember you asked questions about are we going to see a slowdown
because there are now less clinical trials and mega trials are ending. So here we are, right?
We are -- yes, there is less activity, there are less trials. It's not growing as fast as it was last year. But I think our ability to
take more share of wallet and still capture the incremental growth in the market is paying the dividend, and it's what we're
seeing in our results.
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Related to the large deal and basically their weight into the pipelines, I think it's relatively consistent compared to what we
have seen last year. The reality in Q2, the -- we signed a significant number of large contracts. Rouven was mentioning
Jaguar Land Rover being one of the largest, but it's not the only one. It's really across all the geos, and we have not seen
any decision being postponed. And the proof of what I'm seeing is the growth of the direct engagement was higher than
15% for this quarter. So what we have seen, nevertheless, you're right. In -- probably in the United States, this is where
the large corporations are anticipating the most the recessions.
And they have put in place some criteria in order to basically put priorities on their investments. And I was stating clearly in
my comments, we are mission-critical. And we are mission-critical because we play on both sides to help them to manage
the short-term challenges, reducing costs, improving efficiency, managing the supply chain shortage. At the same time,
we help them to prepare the future. And this is where we are. We -- I mean many of our customers have to face this
challenge to compromise between both.
And Bernard and I, we had many, many customer discussion in the last quarter because we are back on the road, and we
have the ability to meet many of them, including, by the way, the partners. And the platform is not any more a question.
For many of them, it's a must. The question is probably when and how, probably how they should start. So that's the
reason why we are not -- we do -- we are not -- I mean we have not seen decisions being postponed. We have not seen
people hesitating or at least a significant reduction of the large transactions in the pipeline. I would say it's probably the
contrary we are seeing. At least this is true in the car industry for us, but also in the new industries such as the consumer
goods, consumer packaged goods, life sciences, you were mentioning it, Rouven. So that's what we are seeing.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16We are going to take the next question. And the next questions come from the line of Charles Brennan from Jefferies.
Charles Brennan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division
I'll just do one, if I can. And that's just on the subscription growth. It's obviously very nice to see you beating your
guidance. It looks like you outperformed by 1.5 percentage points. In euro terms, that implies sort of EUR 12 million worth
of outperformance. And if I think about 1/12 revenue recognition of recurring revenue, that implies you were pleasantly
surprised by EUR 140 million worth of business in the quarter. Is that the right way to think about it or is there some point
in time revenue recognition that takes place? And if that's the case, can you just size the point in time, rev rec for us?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Thanks, Charles. So for the -- you're right, we accelerated to 10%, which we always said we will see an acceleration
throughout the year. Q2 was strong. And the contribution to the subscription growth was broad-based, right? I mentioned
MEDIDATA. And you're absolutely right. If you recognize the revenue on a subscription basis, essentially, you recognize
your backlog of previous bookings. So it's really a reflection of the strong performance in the quarters ahead, right?
Because in the current quarter, there's only so much time, right, to recognize this portion. So that's a good part of this.
It's been the strong bookings performance and backlog growth of our cloud business, which is not only MEDIDATA, but
it's also the 3DEXPERIENCE driven, ENOVIA, CATIA. And I walked you through the portfolios at the Capital Markets Day,
all the businesses that are contributing to this growth. And then what -- of course, what is included in the recurring line
item is the support revenue. And we always said that we will see a catch-up in support revenue from the strong licenses of
2021 and certainly Q4 2021. That's also what's happening.
So it's a combination of both. Yes, it's the booking volume behind this, if we were to recognize all of this upfront, would
be much, much larger. Yes, much larger. There were some big transactions that we did on a subscription basis. So for
example, the one that we just mentioned, JLR, is a subscription contract. It's not a onetime revenue that we've booked. So
it's also a healthy mix of large engagements and deals as well as a number of smaller transactions that contribute to this.
So I hope, Charlie, this helps you to understand the performance overall and the composition of the growth profile.
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
And maybe I should add one thing, Rouven, is most of the subscriptions contract we signed are recognized from
a revenue standpoint pro rata temporis. We are not playing with the upfront mechanisms, right, unlike some of the
competitors.
Charles Brennan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division
You said the majority. That implies there is some point of time revenue recognition.
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
No, no. The only -- sometimes I -- because the way to do it is by putting a non-exit clause, right? That's, from a contract
standpoint, the way to do it is when we have some competitive situation in some customers, sometimes we are doing it.
But for these reasons, not for revenue reasons. And the impact is not significant, right, this quarter. So the growth is really
coming from what Rouven just described.
Just to complement, if you take a product line like CATIA and ENOVIA, the subscriptions revenue is growing more than
30%, the two of them, right? So that's basically the proof that you should see the subscriptions the same way that the
license, it's an incremental growth also for us.

Which should recognize over time.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 26, 2022

We are going to take the next question. The next questions come from the line of James Goodman from Barclays.
James Arthur Goodman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Firstly, just a lot of discussion, understandably, around China. But Asia Pac actually stood out pretty positively at 13%
despite that. So can you help me reconcile the Americas growth at 8%, especially given probably some tailwind still from
the MEDIDATA disproportionate exposure there?
But then if we also, secondly, think about the license guidance for the year and the 1 percentage point adjustment that
you've spoken to, you've been pretty clear that, that's purely China. But can you comment from a product perspective? I
wasn't entirely clear. Is that largely SOLIDWORKS or sort of broader derisking across products that you've taken into the
guidance?
And if I look at the, say, 3-year performance of license, it looks like Q3 is actually a much tougher comp than Q4, but
you're not really implying a significant acceleration into Q4. So within that context around phasing, I wondered if you could
help us with what you've built into the Q4 license and/or derisking.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
So should I start with the license part and then you take the regional, the APAC and Americas?
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
If you want, yes.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Or we can do it in any way or form. So yes, so the 100 basis points of slight pullback of the outlook for licenses is
attributed to the volatility and headwind we faced in Q2 in China, which some of those restrictions and confinements are
still in place. So our team, I think, has despite executed very well to deliver a 4% growth in China, but it was a miss in
license of minus 10%, which is unusual for China because they have a track record of executing very strong. And it is the
largest -- the majority of this shortfall comes from the SOLIDWORKS part of the business because that's where the impact
was larger, with the small and midsized companies that were really suffering and under confinement because their ability
to do business was very, very constrained.
The large ones with presence in multiple states of China, they are -- they have an ability to hedge and to reshuffle the
resources and reallocate their focus so that they -- that we are able to engage with them outside of the area which was
under confinement, which was predominantly Shanghai, which is the main area where many of our customers are based.
So that's the story behind this rebalancing. And because China is, for us, a core market for license growth, that's how this
is connected, yes?
We also answered a previous discussion around Charlie's question on the increase in recurring revenue. We are making
up with this, of course, we need to support our overall revenue growth and software revenue growth with our strong
recurring performance right now, right? And the momentum we have created for the recurring revenue line. So that's
helping us to offset this from a software revenue guidance standpoint for the full year.
Now you asked a question about Q4 specifically. Maybe I address that quickly. We were -- we have a strong comparison
base for the fourth quarter. I think we have good outlook for the third quarter now. I think, of course, the pipeline for Q4
is to continue to mature. It's too early to comment that, but we are -- we stick to our overall plan for the phasing. I think I
would characterize that the first half of -- for the first half of the year, we are a little bit ahead of where we initially planned
to be, which gives us some flexibility. But I don't think that the growth targets for Q3 or Q4, they are achievable for license
and for recurring.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 18Okay. So speaking about the performance per geo, you're right. I mean, North America and Asia at large, it's a proof that
the business model is resilient, right? Because achieving 13% growth for the quarter, which is what we did for H1 also.
And having China delivering mid-single-digit growth, it means, by definition, that the rest is performing well. And the rest is
almost all the other countries.
To be noticed, also, it's something no one asks, but I will use the opportunity to say a few words. You have maybe seen
we issue a new press release related to the extension of the contract with Hyundai Motor. And as you may know, Hyundai
Motor has been publicitized by one of our competitors, claiming that they were kicking us out of the count. And you
noticed that that's not true.
Why I'm saying this? Because we are seeing in Asia and also in America a lot of win backs. So the win rates continue to
be extremely high, more than 80% in whatever it -- in the car industries, but also in the new one like life sciences. That's
what we can say for Asia. North America, I would say, the point is -- this is really where most of the growth is now coming
from subscriptions. Why so? Because it has always been the most advanced country with this business model. And we
see the large transaction moving along this way. It was the case for the largest like Boeing and Airbus. But now we see a
generalization of this model for many of them.
So clearly, that's what we could say. But again, the growth is really solid, robust. The business, the pipeline is extremely
strong and the competitive edge we have, including in North America, is also high and -- for the one who knows us for a
long time, believe it or not, but we are improving significantly our footprint at General Motors, Caterpillar, which has been
one of the largest account for our competitors.
That's it, I think, for this call. So again, I will take the opportunity to thank you, all of you, for the attendance and the active
participation. And I think, on behalf of the Dassault Systèmes teams, I'm wishing you a good summer break, and see you
on the road in September. Goodbye.

Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Dassault Systèmes Third Quarter 2022 Analyst Meeting. Thank
you for joining us on our third quarter 2022 presentation. Will be with us today, Bernard Charles, our Chief Executive Officer; Pascal
Daloz, our Chief Operation Officer; and Rouven Bergmann, our Chief Financial Officer.
I'll remind you that Dassault Systèmes results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. Most of the financial figures discussed on this
conference call are on a non-IFRS basis, with revenue growth rates in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. For an understanding
of the differences between the IFRS and non-IFRS, please see the reconciliation tables included in our press release.
Some of our comments on this call contain forward-looking statements that could differ materially from actual results. Please refer to
today's press release and the Risk Factors section of our 2021 Universal Registration Document. All earnings materials are available
on our website.
And I would like now to hand over to Bernard Charles.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Beatrix. Good morning, or good afternoon to all of you. And I'm missing the visit in London. I've been doing work to or
visiting so many customers.
I would say, if we look at the Q3 2022 highlights, I would say the first thing that was really written in the press release, it's a solid
quarter, a solid quarter with total revenue up 8%. The EPS, strong growth of 17%. And we continue to invest, and Pascal will come
back on this and as well as Rouven, with the headcount up 10% on R&D. Especially, it's a strong investment to prepare the future.
The positioning we have really is really strengthening. We see it worldwide with our customer situations and really the number of
wins and win back that we have and also the positioning with the expansion of the offer, applying science at scale, creating solutions
for customers when we call industry solution experiences, and really leveraging data science in a very systematic way because,
basically, what clients are creating the virtual twin experience can be exploited with data science.
So we continue to -- the number illustrates well that we continue to fully exploit the growth opportunities, both in Manufacturing
Industries, Life Science & Healthcare, Infrastructure & Cities. The 2 first sector of the economy are really with a strong dynamic, and
we have a very strong position. So Pascal will illustrate. The third is, for us, more game changer, selective large project and this is also
going quite well.
And finally, on the highlights for the Q3 2022, we are reaffirming our total revenue growth double digit between 9% and 10% and
raising the EPS growth at 18% to 19%. So as we said at the -- during the Investor Day, we are on good track to achieve the 2024
objectives.
Now if we look at the agenda, I'm going to briefly cover the vision and trends, and then there will be a review on the operational
highlights and financial highlights and objectives, respectively, by Pascal and Rouven.
So let's start with how we are preparing the future or continuing to expand what we have in the portfolio. You are very familiar now
on the -- on our heritage on the way we are exploiting that gigantic heritage of data environment with our clients. And we are also
clarifying, of course, on preparing ourselves for the post-2024, next 5 years horizon.
And you have seen the steps to which we have been organizing the long-term strategy of Dassault Systèmes. That is no surprise to you
here with the move from functionalities to digital mockup to product life cycle management, by the way, which is back now for the
eco-bill with product life cycle management calling for all enterprises to have an eco-bill of how they operate.
The platform phenomenon with the 3DEXPERIENCE platform, which is on a strong double-digit growth this quarter on a very good
position to be widely adopted by clients and small, midsized and large. You have been seeing the results on the Life Sciences &
Healthcare, and we are preparing and we'll come back on this question mark that I put it here as a teaser for what's going to be the next
big step that we will reveal a little bit more for the full year result in February.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 5Now we continue to invest on the science with science-based virtual twin experience. It's a very precise approach. It's not a fake
virtual twin experience. It's really a virtual twin applied by clients in all sectors that we serve using really the multiphysics science on
the data science to really better improve the portfolio they create, the services they create, but also better predict how they are going to
design the future of the waste, not only design the product portfolio and solution product portfolio, but design the waste in such a way
that they can create circularity.
Circularity in our mind is going to be a massive shaker for the 21st century because processes and material science will evolve and
will need to evolve to create circularity in all industries and all sector of the economy, which echoes very well our purpose as we are
in a good position, I think, with the virtual twin experience applied systematically to the physical goods humanity are producing, the
infrastructure on the territory in which we live under -- better understanding of the life science world, we can create an environment to
really better harmonize.
And this is why people are joining us. And we really are a very attractive company from that standpoint. And people -- the new
generation are really excited to participate to this.
So there are multiple facets to it, which are related to creating a sustainable future, because it's both a tactical midterm and long-term
approach. And you can see that on how we approach innovation for sustainable future. We have an expanding footprint in -- with the
lab, with so many new start-ups joining this consortium worldwide.
We continue to expand with 3DEXPERIENCE education. This is a universe by itself to empower the workforce of the future and with
a significant number of universities and school adopting our solution.
We also transform on that -- the other aspect -- our portfolio -- industry solution portfolio to integrate sustainability parameters to help
drive decisions and use the virtual twin as a way to better predict what we call the eco-bill and optimize it.
And needless to mention, we are very active, extremely active with the new governance policy related to the European Green Digital
Coalition. For example, the MSCI, we are very pleased to have reached the EEE note ranking with MSCI.
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, of course, with -- because the idea here is to provide good visibility about what should be the KPIs
used to really measure the improvement in sustainability and circularity. All clients I meet, all partners I meet, and I've been doing a
work tour in Asia, Japan, Korea, India, U.S., recently in the last quarter -- in this quarter, they are all preoccupied to really establish
the strategic plan for that. So we fit very well, and this is why it explains the accelerated adoption of the 3DEXPERIENCE platform.
A side note on the infrastructure of our platform. We are now with our brand OUTSCALE that was initially a [ subsidiary ] further
integrated in the Dassault Systèmes cloud environment.
Why so? Because the more the 3DEXPERIENCE platform is used by clients, the more they use the 3DEXPERIENCE platform to
create not only the virtual twin of their -- of the products, of the way they produce their products, the how -- so the what and the how,
but also create the virtual twin of their enterprise.
When they do project management or collaborative infrastructure, it's the virtual twin of how your company is working. So we
have created around OUTSCALE wide portfolio of business experiences that really covers the business experience, data science on
SYSMANTEC. And we have significant decisions showing that our data is superior to some of the players that you may have heard
about that are specialized in that sector.
Why so? Because the data are connected together, and we can do data science in a very, very differentiating way and, of course,
exploiting process modeling as well as the virtual twin experience.
We have strengthened the leadership team with top executives coming as a matter of fact, from Atos. They left the company and
joined us, and they have deep experience, like Arnaud Bertrand, our Head of R&D; Philippe Miltin, which is really, really very
knowledgeable about that, to really support Laurent Seror, the founder of OUTSCALE, who is going to expand the portfolio for the
future.
To be noticed, we have a clear unified cyber governance. We think that 3 types of clouds are needed, international collaboration
cloud and meeting with global customers. And they say, "We want to have this environment, but we also want to have a private
collaboration, trusted cloud environment," where we have elected a number of players in a hybridized space of clouds, to increase
cyber security and want -- who want those environment to really collaborate together. And we want also for highly sensitive programs
to have dedicated collaboration sovereign cloud.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 6So we are doing the 3 levers, and we have excellent illustration of that with OUTSCALE as we speak. This is not the future. This is
how we are deploying OUTSCALE. For example, at the highest sovereignty level, we have cooperation with for military program.
At the private collaboration trusted level, we have in -- within a geography, we have common laws and fiscal laws. We can connect
players and isolate them from the rest of the world. And then, of course, international collaboration cloud.
This requires very sophisticated overall architecture to make it happen. That's why I think that our cloud is really a singular and
creates an approach that, I believe, will become followed by many other players. You will notice also that the dedicated cloud provide
a clear answer to what is called by certain players edge cloud, but not only.
One illustration, we are creating now local alliances around the world. The one announced today is in France and Europe for
cybersecurity, sovereign cloud with really a joint venture that we are doing with Docaposte and also Bouygues becoming a founding
member as well as La Banque des Territoires. And the objective of this joint venture is to become one element of a wider ecosystem
to provide highly trusted sovereign services for citizens, for health, for administration in a space which can be deeply controlled and
secured.
So we are very, very pleased to announce that. It shows that the private-public partnership in different regions of the world can work
very well, and we are very excited with that approach. There is a good dynamic behind this, and I believe it's providing a very clear
sovereignty answer for, especially, health data, also high mission critical data that could be applied, not only in France, but towards
the European space.
And we are going to have the same approach with other countries through different type of alliances. So we are putting in action our
belief that virtual worlds expand and improve real world. And the reason why I insist on that, and you have seen that before, is we are
not creating a fake world, like certain tendency with metaverse and other kind of things like this. It's really done to improve people's
life in the different area of the world.
With that, Pascal, you have the floor to talk about the next topic on the agenda, operational highlights.
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Thank you, Bernard. Thank you. Good pleasure to be with you today in London. As you can see, we are back on the road. Bernard is
traveling around the world. Then us, we are physically with you in the same room in London. So a real pleasure.
So let's start with a few comments related to the customers. And more -- why I want to start with this because, more than ever, what
we do is relevant and critical for many of our customers. And you will see we have a lot of showcase. I just make an extract of some
of them.
But you cannot imagine how many diversified cases, type of company we touch, and it has been extremely visible this quarter. So
-- and again, it's also on the core, but also new things, for example, like precision medicine, the new nuclear reactors, the battery
domains. So they are very, very diversify activity we are touching more and more.
So let's zoom on a few of them, and I will start with the auto sector. Why so? Because I think it's one of the key questions all of you,
you have about the resiliency of this sector. And I will start by making a bold comment. We are growing double digits since the
beginning of the year in the auto sector.
And the growth is not only coming from the incumbents or the newcomers. It's coming from the entire chain, right? And the reason is
because there are deep transformation happening. One of them is the electrification of the car, the new battery, the connected car also,
and this is reshaping the entire landscape. That's really our point number one.
And I took the example of JLR. Why so? Because you are aware that JLR was one of the first automakers adopted the
3DEXPERIENCE platform at the early days. And now we are moving with them a step forward because they have decided to use the
3DEXPERIENCE platform to connect the entire value network.
And here, we are talking about 500 suppliers worldwide, using day-to-day the platform to do everything from the early designs, from
the basically system designs, the architecture and more and more for the production side. So that's one of the topics, if you remember,
I was discussing with you. This network effect with the platform is starting to happen, and JLR is one of the first, at least, moving at
this scale. That's the story for the auto sector.
The second one is the Life Sciences. And I know, again, some of you believe that COVID has been a chance for us to accelerate the
growth, and what I want to discuss with you today is, in fact, I think the growth is sustainable.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7Why so? Because I think COVID helped us to reveal innovations using artificial intelligence to do synthetic control harm when you
have no time to do -- I mean, you have to reduce time to do the trial. When no one is willing to go any more to the hospital to do the
trial, so you need to do the trial from home. This is so-called decentralized clinical trial, just to name a few. So I think those pillars are
becoming extremely important to continue to expand in what we do.
And last but not least, I think COVID was also a reveal for many of our customers that it's time to connect the dots between
commercialization, research and discovery, manufacturing. Those things need to work together if you want to reduce the time cycle.
The second thing, I think, we are expanding far beyond, the biopharma, the biotech companies. Now we are touching the CROs. We
are touching the med device. We are touching also not only the large company, but also the mid-market. So clearly, we are extremely
diversified, and this is visible in our numbers.
BioNTech is a good example of this. If you remember, we started with them before a few days -- a few weeks before the COVID
because they were using the MEDIDATA platform as a way to accelerate the development of the vaccine for the COVID. And they
started small because it was a small customer for us. And now it's one of the largest, right?
And why it's one of the largest? It's because they are expanding significantly their portfolio in many new diseases. And here it's an
example, they are using MEDIDATA AI, so the ability to leverage the artificial intelligence for the -- to design the cell and gene
therapeutics, which is basically the next wave for them. And it's extremely important because we are really broadening the scope of
what we do. So again, extremely pleased to do this.
If we move to Infrastructure & Cities at large, the topic I want to discuss with you is the supply chain. And why the supply chain?
Because if you want to master this at the multiscale level, you have to take into account the companies, the networks, the territories.
And you need to do this multiscale approach in order to optimize things. And this topic is extremely challenging right now because
you have dislocation everywhere.
The material costing is skyrocketing. The accessibility to viably substitute, right, is becoming a topic because when you have a
shortage, you need to replace some materials, some equipment, some parts. And this is what is at stake to increase the resiliency of the
supply chain.
And here you have one example, this company is called Mammoet. It's leading in engineering and heavy lifting, and they do
the transportation of these kind of things. And what they have decided is to use the DELMIA Quintiq to do the entire network
optimizations.
And why so? Because we have this multiscale and multi-time if you want [ reasons ] of planning. And this is extremely important
because it's not something you can do if you do not have a twin. The twin is giving to you the ability to do the what-if scenarios at the
multiscale and then after you optimize the things. That's what we do. And this is really a game changer for this industry.
So again, those are only examples. But I think, trust me, we are really deepen our relationship with many of our customers, and we
continue to expand and to win new submarket, subsegments.
If we zoom from a geo standpoint, what are the trends? So let's start with Americas growing at 7%, clearly driven by Life Sciences
and the High Tech sector, and we had significant win in the High Tech. You remember, it was probably one of the disappointment I
have in Q2. But Q3, we are back, especially in the semiconductor with NXP, with KLA, just to name a few.
But the most important is, really, the region of the world where the transitions from license model to the subscription is happening.
We do more growth in subscription now than we do in license in Americas at large.
Europe, that's the proof of the resiliency, 9% growth, extremely consistent since the beginning of the year, right? And I think we have
a double-digit growth in many countries, France, the North of Europe, the South of Europe. And EuroCentral, especially Germany, is
also recovering compared to where we used to be because, again, the platform phenomenon is really starting to happen. And we had
good showcase this quarter in EuroCentral, Volkswagen being one of them.
So Asia Pacific, this is growing 6%, 11% since the beginning of the year. And there are some good news, and there are some mixed
news. The good news is, really, Korea and India are growing double digit. If you remember, Korea, we suffered a little bit the last few
years, and we changed many things. And now we are back on track, and the growth is really sustainable in the auto sectors, but much
more broadly.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8India is really increasing a lot, and Bernard was visiting Indian customers a few weeks ago. And you cannot imagine how many
innovations happening in this country. And you cannot imagine how far they go with the 3DEXPERIENCE platform in a domain
where, us, we were not believing that was happening.
So China is really where we had some headwinds this quarter clearly due to the lockdown. We spoke about it. We were factoring
some of the risk in the guidance. But I think we were expecting the Congress to happen and to ease a little bit the policy, but no
COVID. This is not what is happening. So clearly, we will have to continue to be cautious for China for the second -- for Q4.
Japan, some softness. But again, we are growing double digits since the beginning of the year, so clearly relatively consistent with
what we have seen.
If we move to the product line, again, some proof point about the resiliency. If you start by industrial innovation software, which is the
largest piece still, CATIA, ENOVIA and DELMIA are growing double digits, right? By -- just by itself, it's a strong statement.
CATIA, why so? Because the CATIA cyber system is extremely, I mean, valuable for many of our customers, all the one doing
electrification, all the one developing connected objects, all the one basically transforming in deep the engineering things. And we see
more and more contribution of these product lines to CATIA. It's happening in the auto sectors, but also in aerospace and defense, in
almost all the core CATIA businesses.
ENOVIA, ENOVIA is growing in conjunction with the 3DEXPERIENCE platform. Why so? Because people are using ENOVIA
when, basically, they are deploying the platform at the enterprise level. And the fact that ENOVIA is growing really up double digit.
It's close to 20%. It's again a proof point about the consistency about what we are telling you is really happening from a deployment
standpoint, with a large account we won in the past.
DELMIA, we spoke about it. So clearly, the supply chain topic is a topic for many of our customers. How to improve the agility of the
manufacturing production system is also another one, and we see a lot of good momentum happening.
Life Sciences and software revenue, extremely consistent, plus 13%, right, driven by MEDIDATA, up 17%. And again, I want
probably to pause a little bit and step back because, almost day for day, we are celebrating the 3 years anniversary of the merge with
MEDIDATA.
And if you remember at that time, we committed to you to deliver between 13% to 15% growth, right, and to improve by 200 basis
points the operating profit every year. We are delivering 17% after 3 years in a difficult quarter, right? At least, the macro is not
helping globally.
We have exceeded, by far, the contribution of the MEDIDATA to the profitability. We are expanding MEDIDATA outside of the
Rave core products to MEDIDATA AI, to MEDIDATA Patient Cloud. We have expanded the coverage from a geography standpoint.
We're enforcing significantly in Asia, in Europe, in the mid-markets.
We have reinforced our position on the CROs. Whatever the competitor can play, we double the revenue with the CROs in 3 years,
right? And now we have basically -- and we have continued to invest significantly. We doubled the number of people at MEDIDATA
since the merger. And we have, by far, the largest teams of experts in this industry to basically help our customers to deploy the
solutions at scale.
So clearly, it has been a tremendous journey, and I think the future is even more excited. And we have built the foundations for
MEDIDATA and the Life Sciences to become core for Dassault Systèmes.
And just as a side note, since the beginning of the year, it's our largest industry, guys. It's bigger than the auto sector and aerospace
sectors.
So the third topic, the mainstream. So plus 5% this quarter compared to 6% to 8% -- sorry, since the beginning of the year. And
again, SOLIDWORKS is up single digits. The vast majority of basically the slowdown or the headwind we have seen are coming
from China. And to a certain extent, we are seeing some softness in the SMB market, and this is reflecting in the number. But we are
convinced we will be able to return to the normal trend, which is 8%, right, 8% to 9%. That's the topic.
We continue to invest. I'm pleased to announce the small acquisitions we did for Centric PLM. And you remember, same thing since
the acquisition for Centric, we are expanding significantly on multiple axis.
The first one is the diversifying industries. We are addressing the fashion industry. We're expanding the beauty care, in the food and
beverage and more and more into consumer electronics because the collection management is meaningful for those industries.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9We're expanding also from a geographic standpoint. When we acquired Centric, they were extremely strong in the U.S. and in Europe,
but not too much in Asia. Now we are gaining a lot of market share.
We are expanding also from a target standpoint. They will use to serve the brands, and we are expanding to the retailers. And now we
are expanding the solution scope because there is, we believe, the collection management is becoming the business platform for many
of those customers because now they start to do business planning and e-commerce. Because if you want to sell online, you need to
have the product set on show, and the platform is becoming the foundation to make it happen.
That's the reason why we have merged and acquired this small company, StyleSage. It's a start-up. And what they do, they are using
artificial intelligence to do the analytics on the pricing and the optimization for the price. And why it's extremely important? Because
when you are selling online, you need a lot of agility with your pricing mechanisms.
And what do they do? They basically are calling the -- all the website. They extract the information from the website. They have the
ability to recognize the products based on the photo, which is extremely difficult to do, if you want to be extremely reliable. And they
have this technology already working with some of the good reference, Zalando being the largest one.
So it's really a proof point. Again, it's a start-up, so the revenue is still modest, I would say. It's a little bit more than EUR 5 million,
but the ability to accelerate the growth is there because they are serving basically the customers we already have.
So that's it for a quick overview on the market trend and the customer dynamics. Now it's time for you, Rouven, to say more about the
financials, right?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Certainly. Thank you, Pascal, and welcome also. Happy to be with you this morning. Good morning to everybody. As you heard
from Bernard and Pascal, we are quite pleased with the third quarter results. It was an exceptional quarter in terms of highlighting the
resiliency of our business model and our financial model.
As you see, we grew total revenue by 18% as reported and at 8% at constant currency, with recurring revenue up 10%, which now
represents 82% of the total software revenue. And this was driven by strong subscription growth, which is up 16% ex FX, as well as
continued good momentum in cloud revenue, which is up 21% ex FX. Also service revenue increased by 16% at constant currency
during this period. And we delivered all of this good performance on top of a strong first 6 months of the year already.
So what was different this quarter compared to the first 6 months is that there was a shift in our expected revenue mix with a higher
contribution from subscription and lower CapEx-based purchases. So revenue from licenses was down by 2% at constant currency.
This was driven by a preference for subscription as well as an absence of the recovery in China, and I will address this in greater detail
in a moment.
So despite these shifts, as you can see in the numbers, we delivered on our profitability targets as promised. It reflects strong returns
on the investments we've been making over the last few years in our product, in our infrastructure, in our go-to-market and sales
organization.
The operating margin was 31.6%, and the earnings per share rose 17% to EUR 0.26 as reported.
Our growth drivers of 3DEXPERIENCE and cloud continue to be very resilient and continue to propel us forward. Clients from large
established enterprises to new players and disruptors, they are all adopting the 3DEXPERIENCE platform and cloud. They're looking
for platforms to accelerate innovation, they scale operations and drive growth. Again, this quarter, 3DEXPERIENCE was a key driver
of large transformational client deals, as highlighted by Pascal.
3DEXPERIENCE revenue grew 15% and now accounts for 32% of the software revenue, which is an increase of 2 points year-over-
year. Cloud, I mentioned, is 21% up ex FX. And it also is based on the continued strong momentum of MEDIDATA, as Pascal was
highlighting. So it now accounts for 24% of software revenue, our cloud business, which is up 3 points versus last year.
Now let me turn to the financial results and highlight the performance relative to the objectives we set for the quarter. So total revenue
was EUR 1.37 billion, up EUR 65 million higher than to the midpoint of our target range, which benefited from an FX impact, as you
see here, which was EUR 74 million during the quarter. And excluding this currency, we landed between the lower and the midpoint
of our range.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10We reported recurring and service revenue, both above the midpoint, by EUR 10 million and EUR 4 million, respectively. This was
partially offset, as mentioned, by the lower license contribution, which was EUR 23 million below the midpoint.
So this was driven by 2 factors. First, as mentioned, clients displayed a stronger preference for subscription, with an impact of
approximately 4 points of growth on the license number. And this means that we had a few deals that shifted to subscription at the end
of the quarter, which were forecasted as licenses before.
Second, we experienced continued softness in China, as already discussed, due to the extended shutdowns and the restrictions we
experienced. This also affected our SOLIDWORKS sales in China. And as you know, China is a key market for our license business.
It actually accounts for more than 50%. So more than 50% of the total software revenue in China are license based.
And so we had factored in some of the weakness in Q3 already, but the impact was higher than expected. And this, plus some
additional software in the SMB market, accounted for an additional negative impact of 4 to 5 points on the license growth. So when
you reconcile this to the midpoint, there's 8 to 9 points of difference that we had in terms of where we landed compared to what the
midpoint of our guidance range was.
Now let me step back the bottom line of all of this. When you look at the total revenue mix is that we accelerated the growth in
subscription revenue, and this transition is well underway.
We are well prepared. As you can see, we are progressively increasing the share of recurring revenue, while we continue to deliver
the top line revenue and profitability objectives, despite the lower growth contribution from the licenses. This highlights the excellent
resiliency of our model and we will continue to support our clients with the optionality that meets their needs.
We reported operating margin at 31.6%, as mentioned, in line with the objectives, while we were hiring 800 net new team members
during the quarter. We grew headcount by 10% year-over-year over, overall.
Strategy, we remain committed to our plan, to make the critical investments in support of our long-term growth objectives. Also
important to highlight is that more than 50% of the hires in R&D, and they are based in India, of which a good portion also fuels the
continued momentum of MEDIDATA.
So compared to our objectives for the quarter, operating margin benefited 10 points from a positive FX impact and 50 basis points
from lower expenses, offsetting the negative impact from the slightly lower revenue we delivered.
Now turning to our EPS. We delivered strong growth of 17% or EUR 0.26 as reported, above the objective range of 6% to 11%. And
the EPS growth benefited this quarter from a favorable FX conversion driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which impacted
by EUR 0.013 positively and the lower tax rate and higher financial income contributing EUR 0.07 to the improved EPS.
Finally, our non-IFRS tax rate for the quarter was 20.7%, with a guidance of 21.6%, which was driven by a lower tax rate in France
and continued benefit from higher fee tax deductions in the United States.
Now turning to cash flow and our balance sheet items. The cash flow -- the cash and cash equivalents totaled EUR 2,787 million
compared to EUR 2,979 million at the end of last year, a decrease of EUR 192 million. Our net financial debt on September 30, 2022,
decreased by EUR 681 million to EUR 208 million compared to EUR 889 million at the end of last year. This keeps us well ahead of
schedule on our deleveraging objective.
Now let's look at what is driving our cash position this quarter. First, cash from operations totaled EUR 1,281 million for the first 9
months, an increase of 2% relative to last year on the back of a strong comparison base, which was up 24.5% last year.
By far, the largest impact on the operating cash flow performance year-to-date comes from the change in nonoperating working
capital. There are 2 distinct effects related to an increase in income tax payable. First, higher tax payments in the United States in
2022 due to the mandatory capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes. And consequently, the deductibility of these expenses is
delayed, resulting in an increase of cash taxes we pay.
Second, we reported in 2021 a benefit from a sizable withholding tax reimbursement.
So both effects together account for EUR 92 million negative impact versus last year. If we were adjusting for this, our cash from
operations would have been up by 10% year-to-date.
As we said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock
repurchases and prudent use of debt and our dividend policy. So consequently, in the first 9 months of this year, we used operating
cash for share buybacks, net of proceeds from stock options exercises at a total of EUR 359 million. We paid our dividends of EURDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11224 million and repaid debt at the level of EUR 885 million, net of proceeds from a EUR 250 million commercial paper. Which we
issued this year.
Lastly, of note, we also benefited of EUR 218 million from FX, with EUR 203 million coming from Q3 only.
Now let's move to the objectives for 2022. So as we look to the fourth quarter, we feel confident about our business momentum, as we
continue to refine our model towards resiliency and predictability with an increasing share of recurring revenue as a percent of total
revenue.
First important message is we are reaffirming our 2022 total revenue growth objectives at the range of 9% to 10%, but we are
increasing it to a higher absolute range of EUR 5,610 million to EUR 5,650 million, which was EUR 5,485 million to EUR 5, 535
million previously, which now incorporates an update on the U.S. dollar from [ EUR 110 ] to [ EUR 105 ] for the remainder of 2022.
This adjustment of our currency assumption, along with the third quarter FX benefit, has a positive impact of EUR 114 million to our
total revenue objective, reflecting the resilient growth in subscription and support revenue throughout this year.
We are also confidently adjusting our recurring revenue growth target to a range of 9% to 10%, which was previously 9%. At the
same time, we are reflecting the increase in volatility of the license sales to a range of 5% to 7% from 9% to 11% previously. This
reflects lower performance of Q3 as well as returning to low to mid-single-digit growth in Q4.
Second, the operating margin. We are reaffirming our full year objective of 33.4% to 33.7%, reflecting the continued investment in
our future growth initiatives.
EPS, we are raising our 2022 EPS -- diluted EPS objective to a growth of 18% to 19%, reaching EUR 1.12 to EUR 1.14 from EUR
1.08 to EUR 1.10 or 14% to 16% growth previously.
Now before closing, let me also briefly share with you our objectives for the fourth quarter. So total revenue growth of 8% to 10% ex
FX, with software revenue growing 8% to 10%. We are targeting recurring revenue growth of 10% to 11%, with licenses growing in
the range of 2% to 7%, and services up 6% to 11%, operating margin of 34.9% to 35.9% and diluted EPS growth of 12% to 18% to
EUR 0.32 to EUR 0.34 for EPS.
Now let me conclude. As I said, this was an excellent quarter, highlighting the resiliency of our business model in terms of
accelerating subscription revenue and delivering on the operating margin objectives with EPS up 17%. But what I want you to take
away from this quarter is that we are well prepared for the progressive acceleration in subscription growth, while continue to support
our clients with the optionality that meets their needs.
Our key growth drivers of 3DEXPERIENCE and cloud continue to build the momentum. And you see in our updated guidance, we
adjusted our revenue mix with lower contribution from license and revenue -- from license revenue to address the continued volatility
in China and the SMB customer segment. At the same time, we are increasing the share of recurring revenue, offsetting the lower
licenses.
So in conclusion, we are -- total revenue growth of 9% to 10% ex FX, to the higher absolute range, incorporating the full benefit from
currency, and we are raising our EPS objectives to 18% to 19% year-over-year growth for the full year.
And now with this, I'd like to conclude this session and transition over to Q&A. Beatrix, do we have the moderator?
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
Yes, we have the moderator. I suggest that we start with 2 questions from the room. And then...DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2022

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12Question and Answer
Adam Dennis Wood
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Adam Wood from Morgan Stanley. I've got 2, please. Just first of all, there's obviously a difference on how you bring new business in
on the financials, whether it comes in on licenses or on subscription. But obviously, what I suppose is more interesting is whether the
new business closes or not.
Could you just talk about in the round whether you closed the new business broadly that you expected in the third quarter and how the
pipeline for new business looks going into the fourth quarter versus a normal fourth quarter?
And then secondly, when you talk about OUTSCALE, I think a lot of people think about infrastructure, and investors will push back
to us that, that comes with a lot of competition from hyperscalers. It comes with lower gross margins, and it requires a lot of CapEx.
Could you just talk a little bit about what you're doing differently around the OUTSCALE platform that differentiates you in that
market and won't lead to those investor concerns being realized?
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Thank you, Adam. If you -- I can take the first one. And Bernard, you want to take the one related to OUTSCALE?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
With great pleasure, Pascal.
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Okay. Excellent. So the first one, yes, you're right. I mean, the pipeline was interesting in Q3 compared to Q4. Rouven said a few
words about it. It was not weighted by large transactions. It was really driven by a lot of midsized transactions, the largest one being
around a little bit more than [ EUR 5 billion ], which usually in our pipeline for one given quarter, we always have several transactions
exceeding EUR 10 million, right?
But for Q4, it's a different story. I think we have a -- relatively, we have really identified large opportunities. Some of them are
relatively advanced in the negotiations. And they have good reason for that because we have many customers, they want to invest this
year because they don't know yet what will be the ability for them to do it next year.
So to a certain extent, I think the large deals we have in the pipeline, which is again normal, usually, we are backloaded, are extremely
relatively well advanced for many of them. So that's the reason why we have a certain level of confidence for Q4.
We didn't have an opportunity postponing, right? At least, we have the same level of magnitude, and usually we have. And the one
usually which are postponing is because we do not want to conclude on the wrong basis. As you may know, we still have customers
using the end of the quarter as a lever on us. And we still have the discipline to stick to the value we believe our solution is bringing to
them and not to compromise on the prices in order to bridge the gap.
To a certain extent, we could have done this to bridge the license gap, but it's not something neither Rouven and I and, obviously,
Bernard, we compromise. So that's what we can say.
From an industry standpoint, again, the momentum is still good in the auto sector, believe it or not. And it's global. It's not only in
Europe. It's the aerospace and defense, also the cycle is strong, despite the fact that we had an outstanding year last year, but still we
see traction. And why so? Because we have the ramp-up of production. And Life Sciences, we spoke about it. So those are really the
fundamental of the pipeline for Q4.
Bernard, do you want to say a few words about OUTSCALE?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 13Yes, yes, OUTSCALE. OUTSCALE, to understand it, OUTSCALE is our infrastructure. It's a virtualization of clouds, number one.
Therefore, it offers operated services such as operating the 3DEXPERIENCE, the -- owned by me or future services for data science,
same goes with MEDIDATA.
As a consequence, OUTSCALE does support multi-cloud. Today, it's our own and AWS, well known. And tomorrow, we can have a
single view of other hyperscalers. So what's -- why that? Simply because we want and our customers require to have 3 types of level
of security, and I don't think it will be resolved in a cyber governance with one set of solutions.
One is what we call international cloud that go -- goes cross-border. Second is a geospace, highly trusted cloud environment, where
there is commonality in law on fiscal -- both laws on fiscal conditions. On the third level, which is even more restricted, more highly
hyper-secure is for [ highly sensitive ], and we call it dedicated cloud, which, by the way, provides a similar answer to what is called
edge cloud.
And on the value of OUTSCALE is to provide a consistent environment, so those can be operated seamlessly, complying with cyber
governance. In this context, the value of having this approach is we can build ecosystems of additional service providers on our
OUTSCALE cloud environment.
The one we have announced today is with La Poste in France. They have a very large market share in the administration on sensitive
health services -- set of services. And as you know, those infrastructure needs to go to hyper-secured cloud, which is not the case
today. Most of them are still on-premise old architecture, which creates several issues.
And this architecture is compliant with the European sovereignty new rules being defined. And this alliance is one of the first, one
of many hopefully in different countries of the world and will help us to provide the experience platform and business experience
services to highly sensitive administration on services in health and others.
So that's a concrete illustration of why this OUTSCALE architecture and virtualization of cloud is so important for us to provide
answers that are not well addressed by anyone at this point in time for the sensitive customers we have.
Michael Briest
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Michael Briest, UBS. Two from me. Just firstly, on the sort of sales cadence or how are you predicting for Q4 the split between
license and subscription. And is there any way you're looking backwards, you can anticipate that these deals would have moved to
subscription? And then maybe for -- going forward, what are you assuming over the medium term? Is this going to be an accelerating
trend?
And then just in terms of earnings per share, obviously, you got the 2024 target of [ EUR 1.20 ]. If you -- when are you going to revisit
that? Is it theoretically possible that you could guide for a higher earnings number in 2023 and leave it out there?
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
You want to take the first one?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Happy to, yes. So maybe let's start with the visibility and predictability we have for the recurring, Michael, because when we build the
guidance, of course, it's based on visibility. We have good visibility, of course, for our subscription. We understand our backlog, so
we can assess and size this quarter out fairly precise.
That's why we also were confident to raise the objective in the recurring line item to 10% to 11% for Q4 in terms of the contribution
for recurring revenue, which is based off support and subscription. Of course, MEDIDATA is an important contributor to this, and you
see the performance is quite strong.
On the licenses, it's coming back to what Pascal described. It's always a question of the puts and takes, I would say. It's the regional
performance. We talked about China, that we derisked China in our forecast. We did do an adjustment for Q3, but we realized the
actual result was actually below what we predicted for Q3. So we took for Q4 further down to align with the Q3 performance, which
we believe is realistic for license.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 14But we also have, in Q4, a different pipeline where we see larger deals more skewed towards Q4 than what we've seen it throughout
the year so far. Q3, as Pascal said, lack of large transactions, so they're coming back in the fourth quarter. They are advanced. They are
with existing clients. There are programs that are expanding. So we are part of those discussions with our customers.
Now the size of those transactions can always vary. But when we forecast, we typically take a conservative approach to the size.
I see that we are derisked now for China. SOLIDWORKS, we discussed, I think we have also reached a baseline here in terms of
contribution in Q3, which we factored into our Q4 guide.
So all of those puts and takes, we went through in detail. And so we also gave a bigger range for license, as you saw 2% to 7% for Q4.
It is a larger range than what we typically would do to reflect some of those volatility. But for the software,of 9% to 10% growth for
the year as well as total revenue, I think we are well in this corridor.
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Related to the EPS and the [ EUR 1.20 ] objective we have for 2024, you're right, Michael. I mean, I just want to recall what Bernard
said when he said, "We will deliver it, no matter what." And I think now you -- all of you, you are convinced because you asked the
question if it is an objective for 2023.
I think it's a little bit early to speak about this. Why so? There are some currency effects. And we need probably to have more
visibility on the currency before to say something about it. But what is sure is for 2023, we need so much investment from a headcount
standpoint in this year that we want to capitalize on those investments.
So I think next year, we'll have the lever of the top line growth, plus probably some levers on the operating margin as well. So we'll
have at least a choice to decide how far we go, depending on the economy.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Just one thing, if I may add to both of what Pascal and Rouven said.
Mohammed Essaji Moawalla
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
I have two questions as well. First one was, as you think about growth, and you talked about, it seems like you're still looking to grow
next year. Maybe help us understand the category is obviously a lot more relevant. Perhaps, the cyclicality of some of your more
industrial customers is becoming less as your software becomes a core part of the offering.
How should we think of the kind of growth evolution next year? Because in prior kind of recessionary periods, we've seen significant
double-digit license declines. Is there a scenario where licenses will grow? Or how should we think of perhaps the relative resiliency?
And a point around operating margin that you just mentioned, maybe what sort of cost flexibility you still have to deliver that would
be helpful.
The second question is on, obviously, the balance sheet is delevering. Just curious to get your perspectives on some of your kind of
M&A pipeline, how discussions are evolving. Or have you seen sort of valuations reset sufficiently enough? And could you sort of
become more active again on the M&A front?
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Thank you, Mo. Bernard, you want to take one of them or you want Rouven and me to address the 2 questions?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Go ahead, Pascal, take the 2. The only remark I wanted to do on the previous set of questions, and that I think also are well understood
by Mo, is we prefer subscription. It has a lever on our midterm or long term. So there is no surprise on the fact that we will continue to
push harder on the subscription model, of course, just a side note.
Back to you, Pascal. And I will -- I might mention a few remarks on the M&A, but I'll let you go.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Okay. So you're right. I mean, we see more and more of the trends toward the subscriptions on behalf of the license. But I still believe
we, at least I'm counting to do growth next year on the license.
Why so? Because whatever the willingness we have to accelerate these transitions, you still have certain country where it's a difficult
model to put in place. China is one of them, right?
If you want to ensure the business continuity right now, if you come with the subscriptions and a cloud business model, you would
have a hard time because they learn from what is happening in Russia that things could stop immediately. And what we do is
extremely critical for many, many companies. So that's the reason why, again, the trend is really happening. We are accelerating. We
are guiding the company along this way, but there are certain countries where -- and region of the world where it's still not possible to
go full blast.
Related to, again, the EBIT margin and the operating margin, I think we have this flexibility. 2022 was a year for the catch-up. You
remember, since COVID, we were having low net adding headcounts. And I think to continue to sustain the growth, to continue to
fulfill the position we have in development and also on the sales side, we wanted 2022 to be the year where we do most of the catch-
up, and it's done.
I think it's not completely done, but it's -- I think we did most of what we wanted to do.
And hiring 800 people net within the quarter, remember, we are 22,000 people, it's a lot within 1 quarter. So I think we have
demonstrated still our ability to attract the talent to -- globally, and it's not only in one region of the world.
And now it's time also to capitalize. So clearly, Rouven and I, we will probably put some expectation on our teams for the productivity
for next year. It does not mean we will cut the investment, right? But at least, we will take the benefit of the investment we did this
year, to be precise.
Related to the balance sheet, you're right. We will be deleverage, right? So clearly, we have now the room not only to do the bolt-on
acquisitions, but to do some large transactions. The market is, to some extent, helping us a little bit. Maybe still a little bit soon for
some domains where you still have a hype. And frankly speaking, we saw the public company being under pressure. But the private
company, the one being backed by large PE, still not yet the case.
So if the market conditions are still difficult, they will not be capable to exit through IPOs. Maybe I think this will open the room for
interesting negotiations.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Thank you. We will now take 2 questions from the phone. Nadia?
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of James Goodman from Barclays.
James Arthur Goodman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Firstly, just digging into the SOLIDWORKS performance perhaps a little bit more. You were clear on the lack of a recovery in China,
but also mentioned this general softness, I think, in the SMB market.
So can you just elaborate on that a little bit more, specifically what you are announcing regarding any sort of competitive position
developments and maybe around the shape of the recovery? I think, Rouven, you mentioned
[Audio Gap]
What product areas are driving the service's strength?
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Thank you, Jim. So Rouven, you take the first question related to SOLIDWORKS.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes, happy to. Thanks, James, for the question. Yes, so China is, I think, we described that. It's something we started to see in the third
quarter, and it's a continuation in the fourth quarter. Simply, just the ability to meet customers, the ability to travel has been really a
big problem for the SMB market, and that has impaired the growth in China.
When we look more globally on the SOLIDWORKS performance, we have a region of the world where the performance was actually
very decent, where we continue to see strong traction, but we also saw some slowdown. We talked a little bit about the softness in Q3
of Japan, which we mentioned, which also not have a good quarter for SOLIDWORKS.
But I don't think it's structural. It's more temporarily. We actually saw this very good performance, which Pascal highlighted, in
EuroCentral, where we were concerned coming into the quarter, specifically in Germany. But here, we saw a resilient performance
with the top clients. But also I think it was decent in the SMB market. So it shows resiliency.
But when you add it up, James, it's -- the comparison to last year where it was very strong, it's just not at the same level, right? So
some of it, we don't know -- when we will be recovering in China, I don't -- we don't expect it in Q4. I think we'll have to assess it
where we are in 2023, how that will continue to impact SOLIDWORKS business.
But for the other geos, I think some of the softness or pockets of softness we see is more temporary than structural, and we expect the
recovery to occur soon.
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Okay. Thank you, Rouven, to complement on the competitive landscape because that was also the questions behind, clearly, we do not
see the pressure. And why so? Because if you take the 2 product lines we have with SOLIDWORKS, the first one being the desktop,
the version you know, it's extremely competitive products, extremely competitive. People like it, right? And to displace this installed
base and to displace this momentum, you need to come with something extremely different.
And I think this is what we do with the WORKS family. Because the WORKS family, it's a different paradigm. And we have to
reinvent what CAD is about. CAD used to mean computed aided design. Now we believe it's cognitive augmented design. Cognitive
because I think the artificial intelligence can really help you to guide your design. But to do this, you need to have the data science
within the platform. Most of the competitors, they do not have it, at least the one addressing this market.
Augmented because the virtual universe is a way to do an expansion of what you do. If you are designing connected products, not only
you have to design the product itself, but you need to design also the infrastructure related to this. So the ability to do design in context
of not only more the product itself, but the entire system is becoming extremely important.
And design, it's not anymore about designing the mechanical part of a shape. It's designing the experience. That's the motto for the last
12, if not 14 years for us. So -- and this is again happening.
So I think on the competitive landscape, no signal about the fact that we have been displaced by the new commerce or by existing
competitors.
Related to services, I think we have the benefit of the hard work we did. You remember, when COVID happened, this activity was
really under pressure. And we put a lot of disciplines in the way to manage the projects, the programs in order to do -- to use also the
subcontractors. And I think now, we start to see the benefits about it.
And the growth is extremely driven. It's driven by 2 fronts or maybe third front. One is the deployment of the 3DEXPERIENCE
platform in large programs. So this is driving incremental services, which is a good sign, again, and it's consistent with the ENOVIA
performance.
The second one is MEDIDATA. MEDIDATA is going extremely well and the services attached to it also. And Centric PLM because
we are -- I mean, Centric is still growing extremely well. And we need to deploy massively the platform, the PLM platform for Centric
in many accounts. So that's where the growth is coming from. So it's not only one. We have different legs, and this is reflected into the
number.
Operator
And the next question comes from the line of Amit Harchandani from Citi.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 17Amit B. Harchandani
Citigroup Inc., Research Division
Amit Harchandani from Citi. Two questions, if I may. My first question is going back to the topic of visibility, and visibility,
particularly with regards to your customers who may be called as being in cyclical industries. On one hand, some of these customers
are calling out the impact of macro into next year. On the other hand, there are secular trends such as decarbonization, which continue
to move along.
So could you give us a sense for your conversations today, as you look towards next year, particularly talking to these customers,
what's their level of confidence and visibility that some of these projects in the pipeline would convert and come through as
anticipated next year? So that would be my first question.
And secondly, if I may, you touched upon the topic of competitiveness in the context of SOLIDWORKS. Could you also give us an
idea of how the competitive picture is looking like more broadly across your portfolio? Do you believe you continue to gain market
share? And are you starting to see any irrational behavior from any of your competitors with respect to the macro backdrop?
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
Do you want to take the first one, Rouven, or you want me to take it? I'm okay to start. Feel free to add whatever you want. Again,
that's -- Q4 is a good highlight, I think, for -- also for next year because the large deal we were -- we are referring to are coming from
existing customers, the one expanding what we do.
And if you remember, pre-COVID, we signed a lot of large transactions, having a framework, which was a multiyear framework,
structuring the deployment of the 3DEXPERIENCE platform across all the business streams, starting from design, expanding to
manufacturing and expanding far beyond this. And that's again part of the visibility for 2023 coming from those projects, at least this
is true for the direct sales.
The adoption by the supply chain is happening, right? I showcased JLR, but I could have showcased also what is happening in
aerospace and defense. And that's the reason why, by the way, we are growing double digits almost true in aerospace for this year, but
at least in the auto sectors, because there is a contribution coming from the supply chain.
So the supply chain is probably more dependent on the volumes. And if the volumes are dropping, they are probably the one could
stop. But nevertheless, the change of the nature of the products, whatever, it's the EV or we start to see more and more projects,
electrical airplanes. The hydrogen is also becoming a reality, industrial speaking. So this is also has some requirements on the supply
chain to change the way they work.
And for the mainstream, I think innovation is everywhere. So maybe, I don't know, the industrial equipment segments will be more --
will have more pressure compared to what they used to have, but there are so much new things happening. I was mentioning, again, in
Life Sciences, the new medical devices, equipments are coming on the market. It's a significant market for SOLIDWORKS.
So clearly, you do not see SOLIDWORKS only sticking to the car mechanical industries we used to serve. We are expanding far
beyond this, and we are much more diversified compared to how we were 10 years ago. So that's the reason why the resiliency of our
model has improved significantly as well.
Related to the competitive landscape, I think we are still gaining market share. This is obvious for CATIA, right, growing double digit
when the market -- and you know the size of CATIA. This is also obvious for ENOVIA. You remember, I shared with you the win
rates, and the win rates are exceeding 75% still for many of our competitors.
And by the way, an interesting thing, we start to replace Agile in the High Tech sector. You remember Agile being acquired by
Oracle. They had a huge installed base in the High Tech. Now we are starting to displace them because it's a whole product and there
is no anymore future.
So clearly, we continue to gain market share along the -- most of the core. The one where I think we could do better is still simulation,
right? The competitor, and I do not want to name them, but there is one still a tough competitor. And I think the growth for them is
coming much more from the EDA space than the traditional space where we are. But nevertheless, I think we could do much better,
especially because we have the foundation with 3DEXPERIENCE platform, which is really making a big difference.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 18The simulations, it's not only used to do the engineering part and to use the optimizations at the design level. It's more and more used
to do other things like certification, for example. And if you do not have the backbone, if you do not have the life cycle, if you do not
have the ability also to do the data science in conjunction to the simulations, I mean, you do not have the complete story.
But I think it's probably a domain where convincing people is taking more time. That's for the competitive landscape. For -- in the Life
Sciences, maybe Rouven, you can say a few words because you are coming from this.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes. I mean, in Life Sciences, I would say the competitive landscape has always been fragmented because you have partly different
players. You -- we developed strong relationships to the CROs that you refer to, Pascal, right? I think some observers always believe
that they were competitors to what we do, but they are not, right? They're complementary services that they offer.
However, they can do things that we also offer. But it's okay to compete in some areas, but to work together in other areas for the
benefit of both our businesses. So that's the model that we've mastered. So that's not an area that is creating any change to what
experiencing now to compare to what we've been seeing a few years ago.
I know that as we -- I do not mention the competitor, you didn't mention the competitor on simulation. I do not mention the competitor
that MEDIDATA faces more and more. But they are not visible so much in the core areas where we are successful, right? As it relates
to data management, data capture, the managing and operating the clinical trial, that's our core domain where we continue to win
market share. That's what's behind the numbers, right? That's where you see the strong growth.
The strategy around decentralization of clinical trials is a true expansion and incremental growth opportunity where we are taking
market share. And yes, on the other hand, there are areas where with some of their offerings where they are making progress where we
are not so strong, right, where it's a picture. You know that it's shaping, I would say, the competitiveness.
And you saw -- you see our commitment. We are investing. We've doubled the size of the company since the acquisition. We continue
to grow. We expand the number of customers we have. So we are very competitive, and we're winning the deals that we want to win.
And you will see this and can expect this from us in the future. And we always said we welcome competition. It makes us stronger.
And I think it's true for Life Sciences.
Charles Brennan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division
It's Charlie Brennan here from Jefferies. Just 2 questions. In the interest of time, I'll ask 2 number ones. Firstly, you called out
capitalized R&D in the context of the cash flow. Can you just tell us what the benefit was through the P&L from capitalized R&D
relative to last year? .
And then secondly, I appreciate your comments on the improving year-on-year growth in the recurring revenues. But if I think about
the sequential growth in revenues, and I back out the benefit from FX, and I back out the growth in MEDIDATA, it probably implies
that the rest of the recurring revenues were down sequentially. Against the softening macro, is there anything to call out there in terms
of renewal rates?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
So on the -- let's start with the cash one first. I think it's a simple answer. The capitalization, the mandatory capitalization for R&D
expenses is for tax purposes only, so it is not something that is really going through the operating P&L. So it's really a tax mechanism
in the United States, where we used to have the flexibility to choose between capitalization and expensing. That right has been --
doesn't exist since 2022.
So for tax purposes, you have to capitalize, which increases your cash payments for tax purposes, right? So it's not really something
you see through the P&L. It doesn't impact our profitability, our operating income, operating margin. You see a part of that because
we have a benefit from a lower tax rate, which I refer to as a PD impact because that -- there is a reverse impact on the tax rate.
Now related to your -- to the recurring part of our business, and let me break it down for you maybe a little bit better. So for sure,
the sequential growth on MEDIDATA is very strong year-over-year as well as sequentially, and that is reflected in the broad-based
performance of bookings across all the business segments we do.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2022
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 19So -- and you can expect from that angle also the cost to continue because it's backlog driven, and it will continue to deliver growth as
long as we drive our bookings performance.
The support revenue continues to be very resilient, in line with Q3, right? We've seen the improvement from last year. You remember,
we were more in the lower -- low-digit, single-digit support revenue contribution in 2021 and 2022. We started to see the uptake,
which we mentioned to you throughout last year -- this year that we expected to this because of the stronger license performance.
Those things are connected, as you know.
Now on the subscription line, there can be, from time to time, some volatility, right? And one of the volatile impact comes from
SIMULIA. We mentioned SIMULIA was maybe one of the lower light performance from a brand standpoint. And it's a subscription
business because it's token-based, it's consumption-based. So that has an impact on the subscription part.
But other than that, we continue to sign more subscriptions. We continue to see the growth in the subscription. That's what we expect
to see. But the only thing I will really can point to is from a volatility standpoint is SIMULIA. All other aspects are building and
growing.
And as Bernard said, I'm -- you heard it from him, this is our preferred model, and we are working -- we are educating more and more
our customers around the favorability of the subscription model to land and expand and grow.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
But Charlie, the rest outside of MEDIDATA, the rest of the subscriptions is growing at 15%, so which is good.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Year-over-year.
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Year-over-year, of course.
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
So clearly, there is no sign about a deceleration or whatever. I mean, it's on the opposite, in fact. The contribution outside of
MEDIDATA is increasing more and more.
Operator
And the last question comes from the line of Nicolas David from ODDO BHF.
Nicolas David
ODDO BHF Corporate & Markets, Research Division
I have 2 questions. Actually, the first one is coming back on the SMB market, so regarding kind of weakness you saw. You elaborated
well regarding the Chinese situation, but outside China is just a clarification. Did you also see some weakness outside China? And if
so, you seem quite confident to see the situation normalize soon -- quite soon. So what is making you so confident?
And my second question is back on China. So again, you elaborated well on the mid-market. But could you share, based on your
discussion with local clients, what's the current mindset of maybe larger clients you have here? And how you connect the current
situation with the wait-and-see attitude in Q3 and maybe in Q4? And what is your scenario really for 2023 regarding their behavior
and the need they have?
Pascal Daloz

Take the first one.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 20Yes. I mean, Nicolas, I think I can only repeat what I said before on the SMB market. It's more pockets of softness. It's not that we see
temporary in their spread. They are not -- there's no consistency as it relates to that. And some of it can also be seasonal, yes. Let's not
forget that Q3 is always a seasonal impact. We just see that in combination with China, where SOLIDWORKS numbers have suffered
in the third quarter.
And we have -- and sometimes, it goes through the partner channel. And those partners, they have different economics than what we
can offer when we go to our customers direct. So we have to factor that in.
There's a translation between partners and customers. It's smaller clients. They have different behaviors and cycles, which can turn
very fast in times of upturn, right, but it can stall and go slower when things get a little uncertain, right?
And I think we've experienced it in years before as well. But again, it's not consistent. It's in certain parts, and some of it is also
seasonal related. We'll expect some countries to rebound in the fourth quarter that had a softer Q3 and had a strong first 6 months. I
gave Japan as an example.
Pascal Daloz
COO & Director
To complement what we see in China, it's not a wait-and-see position. I think that's -- it will -- you will be mistaken if you believe
this is what is happening in China. The real issue we have is we are selling mainly indirect in China, which basically means we have a
proximity business. And when the confinement is done at the city level, sometimes, you live in the same region, but you cannot travel
in the same city.
So -- and this is really a road blocker for our resellers because they do not have the ability to travel the way they want and to visit the
customers. And for many of them, they need to see their customers. That's basically the way they do business. So that's the reason
why, in my opening comment, I was referring to really the lockdown being really the headwind because if we do not have the ability
to travel easily, this is constraining the way we run the business.
At the point whereby, believe it or not, we took some measure to ask the retailers and also our own team to be relocated in
different cities. Just in case of some lockdown is happening, we are still free to navigate within a certain parameter, within a certain
geographical zone. That's what is happening.
On the rest, I will say, I know the economy is slowing down. But for the topic we are addressing in China, specifically the auto
sectors, you have seen at the Paris show, I mean, most of the new cars, new programs being well priced are coming from China. So to
a certain extent, they are betting on the fact that they will continue to conquest the rest of the world with the electrical cars, and they
are not slowing down their investments.
The aerospace is also a domain where we have traction. The Marine & Offshore, which is also a large sector for us in China is also
booming with basically all the logistics problem. So fundamentally speaking, that's really -- the growth is robust in China. The ability
and [ to diversify ], to capture it by having the people visiting the customer is the real problem we need to fix.
Bernard, do you want to say a few words to conclude?
Bernard S. Charles
Vice Chairman & CEO
Yes. Thank you very much. Lastly, what I would do for Nicolas on the large client to confirm, what you said, Pascal, I met with a lot
of them. There is no -- the slowdown for them is not on the agenda. They are really looking at accelerating their digital transformation
on -- I don't -- I think we have good visibility with the large client engagement for -- not only for fourth quarter, but for next year.
Thank you very much for participating to the call. And we will be hosting an analyst call this afternoon for those who have been
joining us at a later moment. And thank you very much. And of course, we'll keep in contact. We'll stay in touch to continue to give
you the proper visibility, and have a good day.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 4Presentation
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2022 presentation. Who will be with us today are: Bernard Charles,
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Pascal Daloz, Digital Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer; and
Rouven Bergmann, Chief Financial Officer.
I remind you that Dassault Systèmes’ results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. Most of the financial figures discussed on this
conference call are on a non-IFRS basis, with revenue growth rates in constant currency unless otherwise noted.
For an understanding of the differences between the IFRS and the non-IFRS, please see the reconciliation tables included in our press
release.
Some of our comments on this call contain forward-looking statements that could differ materially from actual results. Please refer to
today's press release and the Risk Factors section of our 2021 Universal Registration Document.
All earnings materials are available on our website.
I would like now to hand over to Bernard Charles.
Bernard S. Charles
Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Beatrix. Good morning, everyone. It's a great pleasure to see you for the -- again, for this finally physical after a period of
being disconnected or connected only so with your screen. A year ago, when we started the year, we were quite shy on trying to find
the right perspective. We were going out from -- coming out from COVID. And then just a few weeks later, we have what you know
with the war. And to sum it up, we updated our guidance Q1. Q2, we again updated it. Q3 was soft. I know a few of you were a little
bit nervous with it, and we are demonstrating that Q4 was strong with a very strong dynamic.
So I think overall, 2022, while it's a special year, marked a certain number of milestones that we want to cover with you today. And
basically, you have seen the revenue. I know you know the numbers by heart. So you see that the revenue is up 9%.
There are a lot of interesting things to be evaluated. You will notice that both Pascal and Rouven are going to present to you a new
structure about how we publish numbers compatible with what we have always been doing, but providing further detail to really
promote the idea that yes, subscription is important for us. And it is and it's moving in the right direction. So you will see more detail
in a minute, but revenue was up, the EPS is a strong 19% and the cloud dynamic is also very good, up 22%. And we are continuing to
invest in the future.
We are in some way counter cycle as compared to tech. We have been hiring. That explains also the softness of our little impact on the
margin for 2023. But believe me, we are proud to do that because we know we have levers for the future. And this is also going to be
commented.
Now the positioning of the company, which for me is the most important thing. First of all, I'm pleased with the ads that Meta did.
They are doing good ads for us. Virtual twin experience and they are spending time with -- spending money with ads, and we are
doing the job. Virtual twin experience is really what our customers are doing. They are doing virtual twins. You know it. Well,
airplane, satellites, cars, human body, infrastructure, high tech. Experience means can you simulate it. That's the experience. Can you
stimulate what's going to happen? So we have never been as close as we are to the core of transforming all industries we serve. That's
the number one. And we're going to generalize those approach and practices in the years to come for the long term.
The second remark is the capitalization of knowledge and know-how. You have heard about the data economy. We are focusing on
the knowledge economy. It's a different thing. When you do composites, when you ensure that a therapeutic will work, it's not data;
it's knowledge and know-how.
The third aspect is sovereignty. And I will make it short. We see 3 types of cloud: international cloud; cloud within a scope where
financially and legally, there is a consistency; and third, the integrated cloud for highly sensitive programs. Three level of cloud, I
described them not from the IT standpoint but from the usage standpoint, which is the differentiation that we are going to do, and
that's why sovereignty is important for us.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 02, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 5On game changer, because we move and we think all our clients are moving from document-based operations to virtualization of their
operations.
On the governance, nothing changed really from that standpoint, no surprises, but I will give you a few insights if you are interested.
So we have never been more excited than today with the future of putting science on [ getting ] science, multi-physics science to
harmonize product, nature and life. We have proof points on that. Many proof points across all industries. How do you do battery that
you will be able to recycle? How do you create new mobilities to optimize [ in ] early, being connected, safe drive, all those kind of
things, same for satellite, same for aerospace.
In life science, by the way, 2022 is a milestone. We invested big, concluded MEDIDATA in November 2019. For the first time in our
history, that industry is going to be #1 before aerospace and defense and mobility, which means that it’s relevant, it's needed and there
is a perspective for one.
So I think we will talk on that purpose. I will give you just one teaser so you come back in June for the Capital Market Day. What's
next? This is not a marketing presentation. This is what we have been doing for the last 40 years. Unflattening the world, creating
digital mock up, creating life cycle management infrastructure, then saying we can do this with a platform, the 3DEXPERIENCE
platform, so platformization of our industry solutions. We're committed to say we're going to apply it to life now, and we are going to
do the virtual twin of a human body and we will simulate it, the experience side. This is up on established of proof points.
What's next? Well, we want to add to what we call this experience economy, one thing, which is the capacity for our clients to really
establish circularity in what they do, meaning to really create a sustainable infrastructure for them from a circularity standpoint.
This is very hard to do because it's not about taking an old car and recycling it; it's about taking the material, the basic materials and
recycling them. It's far more complex, which call, that’s my statement today, for a metamorphosis of the entire industry. It's not going
to be the extrapolation of it, just doing more; going to be a significant change and the similarity with life is quite interesting, one to
witness, most to be discussed in June.
With that, the core of Dassault Systèmes is quite simple to summarize. Science-based company, multi-physic and creating virtual
universes that help to do a better interpretation of the reality. That's what we do in clinical trials. That's how you make satellites. That's
how we are going to do new batteries. And that's unique, connecting the virtual with the real. And the value of the virtual is becoming
a higher value than the value of the physical thing, and it's happening in our sector, all the sectors we serve.
So how are we going to approach it? You have been familiar with the focus that we have on what we call spiral of innovation:
imaging, create, produce, deliver. We have applied this systematically for all sectors we serve. That's here for you, the left part of it.
We want to apply that same discipline to things in operation. I use a car. It's an electrical vehicle. I want my profile as a driver to be
assessed and I go on to get a lower price for my insurance because I am a good driver even though I get some tickets one time, two
time.
So -- but no, I shouldn’t. So that’s things in operation. It's happening in life science. It's happening everywhere in the economy. You
have seen the announcement at CES. You have seen many, many things. So we will apply the vehicle to experience, learn, value and
regenerate the solution on the other side, which is the life cycle of it, and we call this the connection. Proof points today when we do
clinical trials, it's on the right side.
What's happening to this therapeutic on this group of fashion, that's not virtual simulation; that's what's happening, observation of the
world.
So our solutions are going to massively evolve from the left to the right. And the second thing, we collect data to really build
knowledge and know-how. More to be discussed [indiscernible], and I give the floor to my friend, Pascal, for the business operation.
No surprises frankly speaking. You know everything. Oh no, so one more thing.
We've been frustrated with the way ESG is evaluated. I don't know if you're happy, but we are not so happy. I mean it's ridiculous
parameters. We want this to become science-based. We are a number of science-based initiatives. We want to put scientific data for
ESG. Many investors recognize that some of those index are not good index because there is not enough rationalization. There is a
fight we want to have, which is to compare footprint, the negative aspect of running your own operation with the unprint, what you
bring to do society. Footprint, unprint.
It cannot be just an absolute number. We are pleased to see that the S&P, who has done an evaluation, I think they have done a very
strong rationalization, interviews. They even interview our Board Members. They look at our battery. So they have not done a tech’sDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 02, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 6analysis of our annual report, but done a comprehensive analysis. And I think those factors should be new factors for investors, and I
think reaching 84 is, from what I've understood, a very good ranking. More detail can be discussed on that topic.
But we are very proud of that, and we will continue, contribute to do it with our clients because the key point that they understood
is that we are going to help our clients be more sustainable by providing them ways to rationalize the way this can be measured, the
footprint, the negative aspect of running your operation, and the handprint, what do you bring to the society to improve sustainability
of the society.
Governance, no surprise, no surprises. It has been published. The only comment I will have on this is, of course, highlight [ duals ].
I did 40 years of [ dual ] with Charles, and I'm going to replicate it with Pascal. So the potpourri aspect of being both Chairman
and CEO is a temporary aspect. Pascal wants a few more quarters to be ready to remove the deputy side of this title, Deputy CEO.
Congratulations. You tell me when you're ready, and we'll solve it.
And I'm so delighted to have Rouven who’ll reveal himself in an incredible way coming from MEDIDATA, having an incredible
international experience, having been in SAP, in India, in California and then on the East Coast and working with MEDIDATA now is
really -- he has -- He's part of our DNA, a European culture, despite the international one. And we think European is important for also
tech. Not only we think it's not happening in America only.
And the second aspect of it is really this capacity to do new engineering, our future business model, to really create on the better
articulation between the value we provide to our clients and earning an honest buck.
With that, I give the floor to Pascal, who is going to give you a color about the dynamic with clients, but congratulations to both of
you.
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Thank you, Bernard. Thank you. Again, it's a great honor to take my new role, and I should thank Bernard and the rest of the team
because, as you know, we are long term at Dassault Systèmes. And I think for you investors knowing that the management is coming
from the ground, for the people having a real journey at Dassault Systèmes, it’s something extremely important. And I'm not the only
one, of course. The entire team is having a huge journey at Dassault Systèmes and a worthy experience.
In my new role, obviously, I will remain deeply committed to helping clients to face the challenges and to make their ambition a
reality in a game-changing environment. So in 2023, we unveil -- if we look concepts, which what Bernard was presenting, which
is how we are making the links between the value creation and the value experience, and I think this shift is opening a lot of new
opportunity for us in terms of new value propositions, but also it's a way to expand the reach in terms of audience.
And I have a few proof points this quarter I want to share with you. The first one is what happened in the manufacturing industry.
Obviously, you know we are the one leading most of the changes in the last 40 years, transforming indeed this sector. In transportation
and mobility, the electrification is really happening, and it's an entire new paradigm. And clearly, we are at the core, but there is
something also happening in this industry. The environment, the macro environment is extremely volatile. And we see more and more
customers using the virtual twin concepts, not to do the virtual twin of the products, but to do the virtual twin of the company.
And Renault, with their program called Renaulution, launched, I think, 18 months ago, that's what they do. And here, we have a
concrete case. As you may know, the price of the raw materials are extremely volatile for the time being. And this can almost crunch
the entire margin of the vehicles. So if you don't know how to predict it, if you don't know how to anticipate it, you are almost putting
the company at risk.
So what are we doing for them? We are using the virtual twin and the infrastructure we have put in place, and we combine this with
the real-world evidence, all the prices come in real time, whatever it's from the raw materials, from the suppliers. And just to give
you an idea, the way they were doing it in the past, it's 100,000 documents they were exchanging across the entire supply chain every
month just to be capable to do the costing of the car.
And it's also an interesting case because all the people know extremely well what we do from a life cycle management with our
3DEXPERIENCE platform. But now they start to realize that we also have these data centricity capabilities, the AI capabilities. And if
you combine the two, it's pretty unique. And here, you have a concrete case.
We deployed this solution also with the cloud, which is also interesting for you because in less than a month, we have been able to
equip 2,000 people. And it's not only the traditional engineering departments. In this case, it's the procurement, the costing, the FP&A,
the finance. So all those new audience, usually we have not achieved. So that's the first case.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 02, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7The second one is Amgen in the life sciences. And as you know, in this sector, the biologic is really changing the games. It's changing
the game because it's a new promise in terms of therapeutics, but also, it’s extremely complex to produce.
Amgen, for the one who follow us for a long time, they're customers of MEDIDATA for all the clinical trials; BIOVIA for the
discovery and the research; and also SOLIDWORKS because they are developing some devices.
And what they are doing right now, they are deploying the 3DEXPERIENCE platform on the cloud to unify all the application,
including the one they have developed by themselves because they want to have one single source of truth. That's reason number one.
Reason number two, they are unifying the life cycle of all the different species, the APIs, which are being the regions for the drugs, the
drug itself, the devices and the processes to manufacture those things. That's the second reason. And why they do this, because they
want to accelerate the tech transfer to manufacturing.
The third reason why they are doing, they are using the 3DEXPERIENCE platform to unify is also they are -- they have 2 different
manufacturing facilities issue on, the one which are chemical-based and the one which are biological based. But the reality, you
need to ensure the same level of quality, the same level of regulatory compliance and again, having a unified way to master this is
becoming extremely important for them.
So for all those reasons, I think again, we are really changing the game in this industry by not only bringing scientific innovations but
also making it industrial, if you want. That's what we do.
The third example is what's happened in infrastructure and cities. And you know you are more than me aware about the situation with
the geopolitics and the crisis in the energy. And now, the nuclear power is back on the scene, and I was reading some statistics. The
internal Energy Agency is expecting the nuclear power capacity to double between now and 2050. But to make this happen, again,
you need to come with scientific breakthrough. And it's extremely complex to put in place, not only from a design and a construction
standpoint, but also we need to connect the entire chain, the producer, the operators, the regulators. And all of them, they have to
move along this way. You know that we are the leader in this industry. Remember, EDF is one of the large customers. You have the
new commerce, the disruptors like NAAREA, I spoke about it, [ to guide ] different things [ the small helpers ].
We are also deeply involved with CEA, which is the French authorities to control the nuclear [ study ]. So I think this entire chain
needs to move at the same time. And that's the reason why we continue to foster the adoption of the 3DEXPERIENCE platform. And
here, you have a concrete case in Framatome, [ developing ] new equipments adopting the 3DEXPERIENCE platform in order to
ensure against the quality and the safety, reduce the cost at the same time and capitalize on the innovation.
So if we move to the cloud, which is also an interesting mix because you have seen most of the example I gave are the customers are
on the cloud. And in 2022, just to give you an order of magnitude, we had 20,000 new customers and more than 25% are on the cloud.
So I think for the one having talked about how the cloud adoption, it's happening. And here, you have only a sample. And you will
notice it’s a connection between very small companies, startups, large enterprises, supply chains. So it's really touching almost the
entire footprint of Dassault Systèmes.
Why it's happening now? I think there are different -- there are several reasons. First of all, we have more applications, more than
processes available on the cloud that we have on premise. So the portfolio is there and it’s there for now almost 2 years.
The second thing I think we are operating and we have the proof points at the highest standard in terms of availability and security.
And this is extremely important for many of our customers.
And third, they are not [ salable ]. I think with 3DS OUTSCALE, we are differentiating ourselves with this international dedicated
and private approach, which is a way to ensure total compliance with the regulations, with law, with also security. And I think this is
starting to pay off.
So clearly, the cloud is -- and Rouven will give more detail about this, but the momentum is extremely good.
Zooming to now the performance per regions. What we can see, we see Americas growing at 13% in Q4, accelerating compared to
the beginning of the year. And this growth is mainly driven by Life Sciences, Aerospace, where we continue to see a significant trend,
but also, High Tech. And you will be surprised the large tech company, you know very well, the giants of the Silicon Valley are our
customers for all of them, and they are deploying massively what we are doing.
Europe, I think we are demonstrating good resilience in Europe with Transportation and Mobility and Aerospace driving the growth.
But the most important thing is still France and the South of Europe is growing double digit, which is, I think, a proof point thatDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 02, 2023
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8despite difficult macro, we are still capable to grow double digits in certain regions of the world where we have large projects being
engaged, and we are driving the entire supply chain.
Asia Pacific, 7% for this quarter, 10% for the full year. And here, you are aware about the situation, China, where we face the
headwind with this successive confinements. But I think we are so diversified from an industry standpoint, from a geo standpoint,
now we have this ability to offset. And you can see Korea and India are going up double digits, and Japan had an extremely good
performance this year. So clearly, we are capable to offset certain events happening, which are ones which are not in our control.
If we look at the trend by product line, I would say the most important thing is you can see the 11% of the growth for innovation, what
we call industrial innovation, software revenue, which is the core PLM.
And why it's important because I'm still reading piece of research explaining that we are losing market share. Again, make the
computation 8% for the full year, 11% for the quarter, ENOVIA and SIMULIA, up double digit; CATIA almost double digit for
the quarter; and clearly, very close for the full year, driven by CATIA Cyber, CATIA 3DEXPERIENCE platform. So -- And I was
checking for you the win rates and the win rates we have in front of the competition is over 80%. And in certain cases, it's almost
100%. This is clearly what happened with Agile. Right now, we are replacing Agile in the High Tech sector. We are also replacing
SAP PLM. You know that they took the decision to stop the products, and they are basically making this partnership with one of our
competitors. So the dynamic in terms of competition is extremely good in this sector.
Life Sciences, we continue the good momentum we have. 12% this quarter, 13% for the full year, which is in the range of what I told
you. Remember, last year was an amazing year for the Life Sciences. And as Bernard was saying, this industry is becoming -- is now
the number one industry. And I was checking also the top 20 large customers we have, 7 of them are coming from this sector.
And it's only the beginning of the story because you see the performance coming from MEDIDATA. BIOVIA is back on growth, and
we see more and more traction on the rest of what we do.
You have seen with Amgen. Now they are considering ENOVIA for the life cycle management, DELMIA, for the manufacturing and
production at scale. SIMULIA is widely used also for the tests especially in the med device industry.
So we continue to expand, and we are pretty confident on this ability to maintain the growth rate in the next coming years.
Mainstream and Innovation, plus 7% for the year; plus 3%. And again, this slowdown for the second half of the year is really coming
from the SOLIDWORKS momentum. It’s impacted by China and also the inflation. Clearly, this is where we have seen the biggest
impact of the inflation because this has constrained some of our smaller customers to do the trade-off in terms of investments and
postpone some of the decisions to be equipped, hopefully, in 2023. So we are relatively confident on the fact that we will be back. And
Rouven will say more about the guidance.
But for China, clearly, the reopening is a good sign. We are still a little bit careful for the H1, but for H2, we do expect to be back on
the growth where it should be. That's for the business trends.
Rouven, you have the floor, to give more details about the financials and the guidance.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Thank you so much, Pascal. Thank you, Bernard. Good morning also from my side. Welcome, everybody, joining us remotely and
here in Paris. So I am in control. Okay, cool.
So we start with the financial highlights and objectives, as you expect for this earnings meeting. And let's get first, a good overview
on our Q4 and full year financial performance. Just to summarize, it's very basic. And simply, we had a very good fourth quarter. The
total revenue with growth of 16% as reported and 10% at constant currency and this is relative to a high comparison base. I think it's
important to keep that in mind.
And these excellent results, as you heard from Bernard and Pascal, they truly reflect the confidence and the trust that our customers
have in working with Dassault Systèmes, especially in times when volatile macroeconomic challenges require fast changes.
Software revenue rose 9% at constant currency, driven by strong recurring revenue, which is up 11%. And the subscription revenue
growth, it's important to note -- take a note of this as it’s accelerating to 18% in Q4, while the license revenue recognized upfront grew
a healthy 5%. And this is also very good news compared to the performance you saw in Q3 where you had some questions. You see
very good performance in license revenue in the fourth quarter. And that's what we projected.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 02, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9Now let's take a look at the combination of subscription and upfront license revenue. They both together rose 12% at constant
currency during the quarter. And the combined growth of both revenue streams is a good measure to look at the new business growth,
irrespective of the contracting model and the customer preference.
And as we continue to increase our share of subscription revenue, it is our conviction that aligning with the business models of our
customers across the geos and the industries, by offering the flexibility of both subscription and the CapEx-oriented license models,
that this creates a unique differentiation of our platform and our offering.
Now rounding out the good performance for the quarter, services revenue increased 15%, as you can see and also that at constant
currency during the period. The fourth quarter operating margin was 34.9% and the earnings per share rose 20% to EUR 0.34 as
reported.
Now this strong finish complemented very good 2022 full year results, which are well in line with the revenue objectives and
demonstrating the resiliency of our model with total revenue up 9%.
Recurring revenue is up 10% in constant currency and now it averaged 78% of software revenue. It is an increase by 70 basis points
relative to last year.
While the license revenue was up 6% for the full year, we also continued to deliver strong subscription revenue growth for the full
year at 15%, and you see the acceleration in Q4, 18%, full year subscription was 15%.
So here, I want to take an important note and highlight for you, which is that the subscription revenue for the full year 2022 is now
1.5x of the upfront license revenue and both together, for the full year, are up 11%, as you see on the chart.
In 2022, we fully executed our strategic investment plan, aligning us with our long-term growth initiatives. And we will capitalize
on these investments in 2023 and beyond, and I will elaborate further on what I mean by that when I speak about the guidance in a
moment.
At the same time, as you can see from the numbers, we delivered our profitability objectives for the full year and earnings per share
increased 19% to EUR 1.13 as reported. And this is well ahead of the objectives we set at the beginning of the year.
Now let's move on to our growth drivers of 3DEXPERIENCE and Cloud. We delivered excellent results again this quarter. Clients
from established enterprises to new players and disruptors, they are all adopting the 3DEXPERIENCE platform and you saw some of
those examples in Pascal's presentation. With the 3DEXPERIENCE, revenue grew 24% at constant currency and accounted for 37%
of software revenue in Q4, which is an increase of 4 points year-over-year. And on a full year basis, the growth of 22% and a share is
33% of software.
Now to the cloud, 22% ex-FX in parts driven by the continued good momentum in Life Science and MEDIDATA, but also you saw
the impressive track record we've put up in 2022 and winning new 3DEXPERIENCE cloud clients that's driving this number of 22%
growth for the full year, and it's improving its share by 3 points to now 23% of software revenue for the year.
Now let me turn to some more details of the fourth quarter and how we performed relative to the financial objectives we set.
The total revenue of EUR 1.584 billion was up EUR 36 million, higher than the midpoint of our target range, which should reflect, as
I said, the resilience of our model and the strong execution by our team. We reported software and service revenue above the midpoint
by EUR 7 million and EUR 10 million, respectively. So EUR 17 million contribution from revenue. And we benefited from an FX
impact of EUR 19 million during the period.
Now to the operating margin. We reported 34.9%, in line with the objectives. Relatively stronger revenue and growth partially offset
by higher expenses, resulting in a small net negative impact of 0.5 points. There was no FX impact on the margin as revenue and
expense impacts offset one another during the period.
Now it's clear from the numbers we delivered on our profitability targets while we hired 400 net new team members during the
quarter. But in Q4, we fully completed our strategic investment plan. We grew head count by 10% year-over-year overall with more
than 50% of the new hires in R&D in India, of which a significant portion continues to fuel the momentum of MEDIDATA. So as
Bernard was pointing out, we are investing significantly in this business.
Now turning to the fourth quarter earnings per share. We delivered strong growth of 20% to EUR 0.34 as reported, which is well
aligned with our objective range of 12% to 18%, and the growth benefited from a lower tax rate and higher financial income, which
contributed EUR 0.012 and a slightly more favorable U.S. dollar-euro conversion rate that had an impact of EUR 0.005 on the EPS.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 02, 2023
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10The non-IFRS tax rate for the quarter was 19% versus the guidance of 21.4%. And this was driven by continued benefit from the
higher FDII tax deduction in the United States.
Now let's turn to our cash flow and balance sheet items.
Cash and cash equivalents totaled EUR 2.769 billion compared to EUR 2.979 billion at the end of last year, which is a decrease of
EUR 210 million.
Now important, our net financial debt, December 31, 2022, decreased by EUR 662 million to now EUR 227 million. That's the
number you see on the right side of the chart. And this compares to EUR 889 million at December 31, 2021. And this, the important
message and takeaway, it keeps us well ahead of our deleveraging objective.
Now let's look at what drives our cash position at the end of 2022.
First, you notice that our operating cash flow is slightly down year-over-year by 5%. And this is mainly driven by 2 distinct effects.
First, looking at the changes in operating working capital, the timing and seasonality played a critical role in the second half of the
year as the collections in Q4 were muted because of the lower activity and performance in Q3. You remember we discussed that. It's
just an impact from Q3 to Q4.
At the same time, Q4, we signed significant large transactions and renewals that we invoiced right before the end of the quarter,
resulting in a strong increase of receivables. And as you expect, we will see this corresponding positive impact at the time of
collections in Q1 2023, but pure timing.
Secondly, as it relates to the change of nonoperating working capital and the evolution of noncash items, the largest impact is related
to higher tax payments in the United States in 2022 as discussed in previous quarters due to the fact that we -- that there's mandatory
capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes. And as a result of that, the deductibility of these expenses is delayed, resulting in an
increase of cash taxes that we pay in 2022. And this onetime net cash impact for the full year was about EUR 130 million.
Now adjusting for this amount, plus an unfavorable impact from the delay of tax reimbursements, the cash flow from operations
would have been up 5% on a strong 2021 comparison base.
And as we've always said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through innovation, acquisitions, stock
repurchases and the prudent use of debt and our dividend. And consequently, in 2022, we used the operating cash for share buybacks,
net of proceeds from stock option exercises at a total of EUR 379 million, we paid out dividends at EUR 224 million and repaid debt
at the level of EUR 886 million, which is net of proceeds from EUR 250 million commercial paper, which we issued in the second
half of 2022.
And so lastly, of note, we had a benefit of EUR 71 million from FX during the year.
Now let's move to 2023 objectives.
Looking at 2023, the key message is that we are on track to achieve our long-term financial objective of EUR 1.20 earnings per share
well in advance. This underscores the resilient business model and the focused execution to double EPS according to our long-term
plan. As Bernard said, we walk the talk.
Total revenue is expected to grow between 8% to 9% at constant currency to a range of EUR 5.925 billion to EUR 5.975 billion.
Software revenue growth rates are in line with 8% to 9%.
We anticipate recurring revenue to increase by 10% to 11% and license revenue recognized upfront to grow between 2% to 5%. As
such, we expect the share of recurring revenue to increase by about 100 basis points to the full year to 79%.
We are forecasting subscription revenue to accelerate the growth by over 200 basis points to a range of 17% to 18% growth, driven by
continued strong 3DEXPERIENCE and cloud momentum, which we discussed growing 20-plus percent. And with this is on track to
achieve the target of EUR 2 billion by 2025.
As we always said, it's our objective to progressively increase the share of recurring revenue from subscription and cloud. This is what
we mean by increasing the share of predictability.
At the same time, we continue to leverage our leadership position to capture more of the market to increase our growth rate of new
business. And this is what's reflected in the combination of both the growth and subscription and the growth in upfront from licenseDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 02, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11revenue, which is expected to accelerate by up to 200 basis points to 11% to 13% growth in 2023. And you see it's growing faster than
the total revenue.
For service revenue, we are targeting 5% to 7% growth, reflecting robust activity, delivering innovation for clients across all segments
with healthy margin.
Now turning to the profitability. Our 2023 operating margin objectives is 32.3% to 32.7% (sic) [ 32.6% ], and this is 60 basis points
below last year and reflects the carryover effect from our 2022 investment plan.
Last year, to compensate for relatively lower levels of investments during the pandemic, we accelerated in 2022 the hiring of
engineers, sales and service resources to sustain and support our long-term growth.
And as I mentioned earlier, this investment plan has been fully and successfully completed. And this year in 2023, we will capitalize
on the previous investments and reduce the hiring rate significantly to absorb this run rate and reduce expense growth, which will
allow us to snap back to the margin level of 2022 by 2024.
Now let's briefly touch on the first quarter objective for 2023.
We are targeting revenue growth of 7% to 9% at constant currency, with recurring revenue increasing 10% to 11%, driven by strong
subscription growth of 12% to 16%. So that's a continued momentum.
We are forecasting upfront license revenue growth down in the range of negative 7% to negative 2%, and the reason for this tough
start in the year is simply a very strong comparison base in Q1 of 2022. And still the high potential for continued headwinds of our
business in China.
While we are hopeful for a return to a more normal operations, we also want to be prudent in the first quarter and the first half of the
year.
For services revenue, we are predicting 11% to 12% growth.
In terms of profitability, we are forecasting the operating margin of 30.7% to 31.3% and diluted EPS of EUR 0.27 to EUR 0.28. This
reflects the seasonally lower margin profile in Q1 and the higher expense level from the carryover effect that I mentioned above,
which will improve throughout the year.
Also, please keep in mind that Q1 of 2022 was exceptionally low in terms of spending because many of the COVID-related
restrictions were still in place.
For additional information on our objectives, I ask you to refer to our earnings presentation.
Now in conclusion. In 2022, this was highlighting it's a year of resiliency of our business. We continued to advance our strategic
priorities and gaining market share, and we strengthened our leadership position. You see this reflected in the acceleration of both
recurring revenue and subscription revenue growth, leveraging 3DEXPERIENCE and cloud.
We completed our investment plan to support our long-term growth opportunities while delivering on our profitability objectives,
growing EPS 19% year-over-year.
For 2023, we are providing strong guidance, despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop, positioning us to advance towards our
EPS objective of EUR 1.20, which puts us ahead of the schedule.
And therefore, we invite you already this year to join us at our next Capital Market Day, this coming June at our headquarter in Paris
to talk about the next upcoming financial and long-term plans. So we hope you can all join us.
And now I would like to turn us to questions. Bernard, Pascal and I will be happy to take your questions.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 02, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12Question and Answer
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you, Rouven. And I suggest that we start first with some questions in the room, if there are any.
Laurent Daure
Kepler Cheuvreux, Research Division
It's Laurent from Kepler Cheuvreux. Just 2 questions for me. The first is if you could share with us a broad overview by vertical the
top 3 or 4 verticals, what you're seeing in terms of demand for 2023.
And my second question is back to the cloud revenue. Could you give us a bit of granularity, excluding MEDIDATA, the main
drivers?
And also, I don't know if you have that information, but the profitability of the cloud ex MEDIDATA, what do you see? Do you have
worries compared to your on-prem business?
Bernard S. Charles
Chairman & CEO
Pascal, do you want to start with the first one or?
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Okay. I start with the first one which is the verticals. Yes. So let's start with now the largest industry which is Life Sciences. As I was
telling you, you could assume that we will continue to deliver on the same momentum, maybe with a different mix because I think the
-- I do expect more contribution from BIOVIA and also from the rest of the portfolio. But overall, I think this industry is extremely
healthy. And more than ever, we are gaining market share into this space.
The auto sector, we had a good year in 2022. You have noticed it. Quarter-by-quarter, we deliver. And now, we see also large
incumbents. The one was taking their time, let's say, this way, to move to 3DEXPERIENCE platform, moving especially in Germany.
It's happening. So to a certain extent, I have relatively good confidence on the auto sector as well, including the supply chain. I
heard some of you had some concern about the newcomer, the EV guys, because some of them are, financially speaking, in difficult
situations. But the vast majority of the customers we have are really the one having certified their vehicles. Now they are basically
introducing the vehicles and the traction is coming on the manufacturing side because now they need to produce it at scale.
Aerospace, again, it's going also well. You saw that. I think Rouven was mentioning it, large European company in aerospace willing
to hire more than 13,000 people. And the reason is because it has to produce the backlog. So the fact that the volume are back is
extremely important for us to continue to fulfill the growth.
The vertical on which we are still a little bit careful is Industrial Equipment because the level of exposure to the mainstream market is
higher and especially in China. And that's the reason why, based on my comments, we are cautious for H1. And if China is reopening
well, we could expect to have some acceleration on the second half of the year.
The consumer side, business is also interesting. So it's shifting from, I would say, the traditional consumer goods products like the one
you are buying on a daily basis to the consumer electronics, where we are gaining more and more market share. And I was mentioning
to you that we signed some large contracts in Q4. This will continue also in 2023 with the large giant -- the tech giants in the Silicon
Valley. So with this, I think you have a good understanding of the momentum.
The key point I could add is compared to 2022, if I look at the pipeline, the real differences is I think we have much more visibility
and confidence with the partners. You remember, we are selling through partners and especially the one addressing the auto and the
aerospace supply chain, I think the pipeline is much better compared to where it was last year at the same time of the year.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VPDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 02, 2023
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 13Thank you, Pascal. I take the second part of your question regarding the cloud and the insight, maybe to help you better understand the
dynamic. 22% cloud subscription growth for the total, very consistent. We know we said MEDIDATA is growing in the range of 13%
to 15%, and that is the case. So we see good continued momentum for MEDIDATA. Of course, at a very large scale, MEDIDATA
cloud revenue is -- as you know, it's the largest component in the cloud revenue growing at between 13% to 15% on average. We had
quarters where we were growing higher, but keep it at 13% to 15%, that's a good framework.
Now the other 3DEXPERIENCE products, 3DEXPERIENCE cloud products, 3DEXPERIENCE cloud solutions are growing much
faster, much, much faster. And I can go through my list that I have in front of you here. I can mention those who are growing the
fastest.
In the mainstream market, SOLIDWORKS is growing fast. It is at a smaller base, but it's growing very fast. CATIA
3DEXPERIENCE is growing very fast. I mean we talk about the renewal case, it is CATIA 3DEXPERIENCE. We also see very good
traction in BIOVIA cloud. We have -- we talked about that we are transforming BIOVIA from an on-prem model to the cloud and we
see that taking off very well. Centric, very strong cloud component business, which is growing nicely. SIMULIA, there's more and
more cloud traction that we see as also more and more of the SIMULIA capabilities are 3DEXPERIENCE based.
So there's a broad-based momentum behind 3DEXPERIENCE and cloud, which is far beyond MEDIDATA. That's my message to
you. And when you do the math, you will realize that the number is almost close to triple digits in terms of growth that we see.
So our objective really is with this portfolio to be close to doubling the revenue growth year-over-year. That's what we are doing,
right? And we are delivering this through our 3DEXPERIENCE strategy and that more and more new customers are adopting in the
cloud first as well as incumbents are expanding to the cloud.
On the margin, maybe one word on the margin. The margin is like the margin -- the on-premise margin, there's no difference to us.
We are pricing the cloud component into our offering. We also need to know that when we sell the cloud, in most of the cases and
what you see reflected in our financial statement, it’s based on our infrastructure in 3DS OUTSCALE.
When a customer decides to go with a third-party cloud provider, it's not part of our financial statements. So we do not include those
into our financials as a cross revenue as many other tech companies are doing. So there's no margin impact from third-party cloud
providers in our financial statement.
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
Do we have another question from the room? Otherwise, we will move to the call. Thank you.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Frederic Boulan from Bank of America.
Frederic Emile Alfred Boulan
BofA Securities, Research Division
If I can just come back on that subscription dynamics, and if we can spend a bit of time on the demand. So you talk about growth
rates, but from a low level. Maybe if you can share with us what type of customers are moving and whether they go primarily for
subscription model on-prem or if it's largely cloud?
And then if you can also help us quantify the overall net revenue impact. I think it's helpful to talk about this subscription plus in
upfront revenue. But if you can help us identify the underlying revenue impact if we net the license plus the subscription impact.
And then secondly, if you can give us an update around M&A priorities across your different segments. Where do you stand right
now? Where do you see the most attractive opportunities to fulfill your 2040 ambition?
Bernard S. Charles
Chairman & CEO
Okay. So I will answer at least to the first part of the question and maybe the last part at the same time. So the fraction of the customer
moving to the cloud are really it’s products-based now. If you remember a few years ago, the project-based industry were really the
core. We were talking about construction, we were talking obviously about the clinical trial because there is a start and an end. And
why so? Because the cloud was giving this flexibility if you want to and this agility to connect different stakeholders easily.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 02, 2023
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 14Now with the data centricity of the platform and the collaboration capability of the platform, it's another game. We see more and
more. And again, you have seen Renault. This is not the only one. So large company having a significant P&L deployments and
moving to the cloud. And for me and for our customers, I mean, they have a road map. Obviously, it's not something they can do
overnight. But for many of them, now they have a road map plan and [ so as an example ], they expect to do this transition in the next
5 years.
We are also -- we continue also to have the startups. Many of them are start from directly with the cloud. And clearly, the consumer
parts of what we do just because they do not have large [ interbase ] in our sectors, many of them, they start also straight to the cloud.
So clearly, this is where are.
We believe it or not, the aerospace is also moving, obviously, with a different set of requirements. And that's, again, the reason why
having this 3DS OUTSCALE with this ability to do a dedicated cloud, which is nothing more than the future of what you call on-
prem. On-prem is now -- it will be not any more the application being inside the desktop. It will be the cloud dedicated for them on
their premise but managed by us. So that's the entire strategy, and we see large aerospace company moving along this way, whenever
it's in Europe, also in the U.S.
The last part of the question, which was related to the M&A, of course, we are almost leveraged. You have seen it. So now we have
some new room to maneuver. We didn't stop, by the way, to do the M&A. We did some bolt-on, but this is -- sure this is now we have
much more flexibility to consider a sizable move.
I will not say more. We have a Capital Market Day in the beginning of the year. And frankly speaking, we have opportunities in the
3 sectors of the economy. So the question is not too much the target is -- or potentially with who we could merge, it’s much more, is
it the right time? Are we prepared to do this? Is the business plan okay? And are we capable to create value on top of this? That's the
things.
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
We thought we could buy and not merge, because we want to keep the control of our content, of course.
Bernard S. Charles
Chairman & CEO
Of course.
Operator
And the next question comes from the line of James Goodman from Barclays.
James Arthur Goodman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
A couple for me then as well, please. Can we first of all, just focus in on the margin a little bit more? I think you showed that OpEx
development in the quarter was a 1.2 percentage point deviation from the midpoint. So what was it exactly in the quarter that caused
the elevated OpEx? And perhaps you can help us a little bit more with the moving parts in the OpEx development next year. It sounds
like you're still adding some heads net and I guess there's some wage inflation coming through there.
And the second question, on the cash flow, please. Just you made some clear comments around the impact from Q3 and the billings
being weighted towards the end of Q4. But I think there was an expectation that we might be fully delevered already by this point. So
I'm wondering if there are any other parts there what you're expecting that to do in '23 and whether customers are changing payment
behavior at all as rates increase.
Bernard S. Charles
Chairman & CEO
Rouven, I think you excel in that domain.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
All right. So maybe I'll take the second first and then I come to the margin. James, thank you for your questions. So yes, our target,
we were -- we are on trajectory and we are far ahead of the plan to delever. You’ll remember, it was -- it's actually planned by the endDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 02, 2023
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15of this year. In Q4, we had some timing differences that were the tune of EUR 300 million to EUR 400 million, right, of unfavorable
cash timing between Q4 and Q1. So we will see in Q1 that we will be delevered. That's the objective. That's what we expect. It's a
pure timing impact.
And my comment on Q3 is really related to when we had softer results in Q3, also that was reflected in billings and then it flows
through to the collections in the following quarter. So is something that we had to work through. But at the same point in time, the
real strong business momentum in the fourth quarter delayed. This had an increase in receivables, and we will collect them in the first
quarter.
To be clear, there is no different customer behavior in terms of billing terms or terms that they are asking for. That is not what's
happening here.
Then back to the margin, the first question. So in Q4, we were at the lower end of our margin. Yes, you are right. And the result of this
is we've successfully completed our hiring plan. We were hiring a little bit faster. So there's an increase of expenses as a result of that.
We also had a strong finish in the fourth quarter, as you know. And when you finish strong, you have the sales folks who earn their
commissions, which is a good thing. And so that's reflected as well.
So that’s really the momentum and executing according to our plan that we set. That's the Q4 story.
Now 2023, I think I was explicit and you understand it correctly that we have a carryover effect from the investments we made in
2022. And that run rate and carryover is probably twice the size of what the normal run rate is. And that will normalize through the
course of the year as we are more dialing back the rate of hiring, and we will be disciplined on spending, and we'll be back at the
margin level in 2024 of 2022.
Operator
And the next question comes from the line of Toby Ogg from JPMorgan.
Toby Ogg
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
A couple from me as well. Maybe just firstly, just on the license growth phasing through the year. So you've obviously guided for the
minus 7% to minus 2% in Q1. Should we be expecting a similar level of license growth in Q2 and then a bigger step up in the second
half, or more of a linear acceleration from the Q1?
And then secondly, just again, coming back on the license to subscription element. In the third quarter, you helpfully gave us the
headwind from any deals switching from licenses to subscription. Could you give us a sense as to whether there was any headwinds in
4Q from that dynamic?
And then also just give us a feel for sort of what you factored into the ‘23 license growth guidance from that dynamic as well?
Bernard S. Charles
Chairman & CEO
Maybe I can start and feel free to add what you want. So my first comment will be for you to be -- you were basing on the fact that we
will be for Q4 with a license. And I think you are now having a good surprise about the fact that not only we deliver, but we deliver on
the higher range of what we were expecting with a strong comparison base.
Why I want to make these comments because I want to echo what Rouven said. We want to keep the 2 models. And we have --
you have to stop to play against each other. At the end, those 2 are good. The reason why we do this is because we want to comply
with the business model of our customers. Not all of them are capable to do expensive, especially the one receiving funding from
[ government ] for example. For those, you need to have a CapEx-based approach. And that's the reason why we are keeping the 2.
Now coming back to your questions. What is reflected in the guidance for Q1 is, to a certain extent, the strong comparison base we
had last year, if you remember and the China uncertainty we have related to the reopening, and that's the reason why we took some
cautiousness in upfront license for Q1. It's our style. It's our style and one is applying the same disciplines we used to have over the
last 20 years, please.
So we could expect if China is reopening to see obviously an improvement of this. And if you remember, the second half of the year,
the base comparison is much better because we started to have the impact last year.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 02, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16Just to give you an order of magnitude. The impact of China last year, only for the mainstream market, it's EUR 25 million with our
opportunity we are not being able to catch. So it's material. So if you believe that the reopening will happen and to a certain extent,
the base is much better in terms of comparisons, you will see this acceleration over the quarter. That's the underlying assumptions on
which we have built the guidance.
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Yes. And there was -- I mean, in terms of the Q3, Q4 dynamics, Q3 was software, and we talked about this because it was also
reflected in our pipeline as such. Q4 was strong, and we were clear when we set our guidance for the fourth quarter, and we delivered
that. So everything that was planned to deliver has been delivered in the fourth quarter.
Operator
Now we're going to take our last question over the phone. And the question comes from the line of Nay Soe Naing from Berenberg.
Nay Soe Naing
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division
Let me ask a few questions. Maybe one for you, Rouven. Talked a lot about -- already talked a lot about the margin progression in
2023. Just I understand that there will be carryover costs from '22 into '23. Could you maybe guide us in terms of how we should
think about year-on-year increases in operating expenses? Presumably, as we're coming off quite a large increase in 2022, how should
we then think about the year-on-year increased levels in '23? And if you could split it between H1 and H2, that would be incredibly
helpful.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
So I think this will help to sharpen your models, and I'll be happy to give you some insights. So 2022, the growth in OpEx over
2021 was around 11% ex FX. Now for the guidance coming into 2023, in the range of the objectives we have set for the top line, the
expense growth, between 9% to 10% for the year.
And as you see in the first quarter, you see a higher margin there, right? Because also, we compare unfavorably against Q1 '22, where
we had a lot of restrictions and less spending, so there is a margin progression throughout the year in terms of your H1, H2 comment.
Bernard S. Charles
Chairman & CEO
And maybe I can make a comment on this. If you step back, at the end, we are delivering the commitment on the EPS a year in
advance. And we are investing when the entire industry is laying off, which is, to a certain extent, a good way to catch the talent. So I
think it's maybe [Technical Difficulty]
Nay Soe Naing
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division
So sorry, I didn't quite catch the last bit. You were mentioning that the talent availability in the industry has become -- could possibly
become favorable for you?
[Technical Difficulty]
Bernard S. Charles
Chairman & CEO
In Paris, sunny Paris at that point. Thank you very much, and we always enjoy to continue to keep the quality relationship to address
all your questions. All the best year for you.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 02, 2023

Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
Good morning, everyone. This is Beatrix Martinez speaking. Dassault Systèmes VP Investor Relations. From the company, we have
Bernard Charles, Chairman and CEO; Pascal Daloz, Deputy CEO and COO; and Rouven Bergmann, CFO.
I would like to welcome you to Dassault Systèmes First Quarter 2023 Webcast Presentation. At the end of the presentation, we
will take questions from participants. Later today, we will also hold a conference call. Dassault Systèmes results are prepared in
accordance with IFRS. Most of the financial figures in this conference call are presented on a non-IFRS basis, with revenue growth
rates in constant currencies, unless otherwise noted. For an understanding of the differences between the IFRS and the non-IFRS,
please see the reconciliation tables included in our press release.
Some of the comments we will make during today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements, which could differ
materially from actual results. Please refer to our risk factors in our 2022 ‘Document d'enregistrement universel published on March
17.
I will now hand over to Bernard Charles.
Bernard S. Charles
Chairman & CEO
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining this call that we are going to share with Pascal and Rouven. The first quarter
is, we qualify that solid. We could debate about the term depending on how you want to look at it, but the revenue was up 10%, the
recurring revenue. Subscription was up 14%. And you know that we want to continue to increase that part of it. The 3DEXPERIENCE
was up 10% and Cloud up 17%, which by the way is connected to the subscription model. The cash was strong at 24%. And as
you could notice, after 3 years, we have reimbursed all our debt or at least we are cash positive after this significant move with
MEDIDATA, which I think was the right thing to do.
Operating margin at 31%, and we continue to invest. Remember, we invested last year towards the end of the year, too, and we
continue to invest with headcount up 8%. It's in some way counter circle with the tech sector, but we think it's a proof point that we
believe that we have opportunities forward.
The beginning of the year in China was slow. We have seen a better March. I think the post-COVID was a little bit complicated there,
but the market is a big market. Financial objectives are reconfirmed for the full year, with total revenue growth at 8% to 9%, EPS on
track to achieve our 5 years plan at EUR 1.2, which was EUR 6, 5 years ago. And as you remember, the division by 5.
Our ambition is to continue, and we are confirming that with the showcase we have for the first quarter and full year, game changer
innovation. I think the industry of the 21st century is not going to be the one from the previous century and customer relationship is
very high in terms of trust, in terms of cooperation, and in terms of long-term engagement. Our ambition, we will come back. I will
not cover that much because we have the CMD, Capital Markets Day, in June. We'll come back on that topic. And we will, of course,
reflect on the key objectives for the next 5 years plan with the new team onboard. So that's the highlight for the Q1.
I think just as teasing for the CMD, we are well prepared for the next 5 years. We have a clear vision on a pragmatic approach
to really take advantage of what's happening, the extensive use of virtual twin experience in every market we serve, whether it's
Physical Goods, Production System, Life Science, Infrastructure. They are not equal in maturity, but I think this is really a solid
foundation where we are continuing to differentiate. So if you look at the overall perspective of what we did 3D, Digital Mock-up,
Lifecycle Management, then putting the platform in place to create experiences on the virtual twin of now Life. I think it's a very well-
architected environment for the long-term achievement for Dassault Systèmes.
A quick video that will illustrate the progress to really realize the virtual twin of human from the cell to the organs.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 5[indiscernible] ready to grow the number on to the new team and soon Pascal to be the CEO. It is that if we were to do an IPO those
days, we have an extremely strong story for the future. So the question for -- this is why Dassault Systèmes is long term. As everyone
should remember, we are a family-controlled company, and that's an important thing because we can really put a lot of energy to
prepare for the future. And I think this is the spirit in which we are going to prepare the CMD, the Capital Market Day in June, to
really provide a sound perspective about why those levers are there.
It's a new world for design, the 3DEXPERIENCE world. It's also a new world to automate things, not only production with robots.
At the Experience forum, the 3DEXPERIENCE WORLD forum, which was very successful, we presented how the system will auto
generate parts from specifications using AI-based technology. It works at scale, and we are going to have large customer test coming
in the mid of the year. So what you have seen with AI use in text analytics on new user interface for people in front of a screen, we are
applying it to design, the design world, on the evaluation of experiences, both for sustainability, how do you change material quality,
material characteristics, and there are a few great stories about that, that Pascal will talk about soon, talking about customer.
So this idea that in the future of design, in the future of production, AI will play a big role, we are already there. AI has been used
in V5 for generative design for cars and planes, and we are continuing to expand that and explain to customers what we've never
revealed of what is inside the system, but we have a very, very deep understanding about different techniques to apply AI.
By the way, natural intelligence is still useful. So we have AI on NI, natural intelligence. So don't forget NI. Don't forget NI.
Algorithms are still good. An incredible dynamic and this is why I told the team in charge now, if you think about the footprint and
the number of new logos, we are touching with Cloud, it's a new exciting world. We have very small customers on Cloud. We have
also very large customers, but a lot of small customers. It's an exciting moment to see how innovation is happening with very small
companies. We have companies with 1 or 2 licenses, growing. Remember the story that we talked to you about 16 months ago, Plenty,
doing vertical farming in Seattle. They started with 2 users. They have now more than 100 users.
So nobody would have expected us there. Cloud enables us to reach those. This is why I think the landscape and the nature of those
logos you will have to print, for some of you having the time to just look at what those logos are doing, you would be surprised with
many of them not expecting Dassault Systèmes to be there. And I think that's a new world, because it's not about design, it's about
how can I do the virtual twin, so I can improve my business. Whether it applies to the what you offer, to the how I do my business,
and even who is doing it, my supply chain. More to be discussed in June.
You have to really understand that our scope is changing, not only changing from physical things, an airplane is a thing, to life, but
also in terms of where virtual twin can be used. We have been in this IFWE Loop, we call it the IFWE Loop. On the left side of
this loop, which is innovation. The right side is about experience in use, profiling how a vehicle is used by a consumer, so you can
improve the vehicle. We have the data for that now, and it will change everything. Profiling the physical products in use is changing
the way innovation is going to happen in the future, and we solve a lot of problems for companies like Tesla and others looking at the
data for the vehicle in operation. And this is happening for airplanes, this is happening for trains, this is happening for many, many
others. We call this the spiral of experimentation.
So you have on one side the spiral of innovation. The spiral of experimentation on the IFWE Loop is the very nature of transforming
how you engineer the next products. Very important when you do energy management for a vehicle, for example. If you don't know
the profile of usage, it's very difficult to do optimization of it. So it creates a new landscape for solutions, which are really being
implemented with certain customers.
One or 2 remarks on customer. I think what the PepsiCo decision is a very interesting decision. And the reduction of raw material
usage is massive to serve as well as packaging efficiency with recyclability expanding. All companies on the planet have these
challenges and without simulation, it's very difficult to do it. So I think it's a good illustration of how the trends on the footprint of
Dassault Systèmes in different industries can play beyond removing errors, reducing engineering change, or improving capacity to
produce. It's about connecting 2 things: the experience economy, the sustainable economy and doing a synthesis of the two. I think
this is our purpose.
With that, I give the floor to Pascal, which it's clear, you all know, I'm looking forward to have him telling me when he wants to be the
CEO. I negotiated deputy CEO, he accepted this year. So I hope that he will soon say, okay, remove deputy, so I will have to address
all those topics. Pascal, you have the floor.
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Thank you, Bernard. Thank you. Thank you. Hello, everyone. Good morning, and it's always a pleasure to be with you in London at
this time of the year. Let's start with some operational highlights and with the tone of the conversation we have with customers rightDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL  APR 26, 2023
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 6now. For many of them, it remains volatile, let's say, their business environment, but the reality, it's an opportunity for us. Why so?
Because they need to increase the agility, the profitability, and they are turning to us to get the solutions to do real-time analysis of
the raw materials, the part substitutions, as well as reshaping their entire value network in the context also where the regulations like
REACH, for example, is imposing a lot of on them. So let's zoom on a few examples this quarter.
Let's start with the manufacturing industry and the mobility. As you may know, we are driving most of the electrification of the car.
Ford, it's a longer time partner with us, but they have decided to standardize all their, they call it, e-mobility which is the EV, the
connected car, and they are standardizing on 3DEXPERIENCE platform. Why so? Because the game is changing. On one hand, you
have the new generation of battery coming. We are not thinking any more about the lithium, but the sodium is coming, and we could
expect to have a [indiscernible], so you need to have the agility of the start-ups in order to introduce the innovations. But at the same
time, it's becoming a volume-based business. And you have seen Tesla dropping the prices by almost 20%. By doing so, they have put
many of carmakers out of the markets. It's not any more premium. It's becoming mainstream.
So you need to have the ability to do both at the same time, and this is the reason why the 3DEXPERIENCE platform is the choice for
many of them, if not all of them. So that's the reason why Ford took this decision. And again, we continue to diversify. Now if we step
back and we look at what's happened overall in this sector, which is interesting. So you remember, we started 10 years ago with all the
newcomers, and look at them, all of them, they have standardized on 3DEXPERIENCE platform or CATIA or SOLIDWORKS, all of
them, the top 10, all of them, they are equipped with our solutions. And we started again more than 10 years ago.
If you look at the OEMs, that's an interesting thing also. 72% of the cars have been engineered with CATIA for the last decade. If
you look at the new EV cars, it's 85% of them, which basically means we have more penetration with 3DEXPERIENCE platform on
the EV segments than we used to have on the traditional car. And 70% of the OEMs are already equipped with 3DEXPERIENCE
platform, which is for us the launch pad to continue to expand, because you remember, by doing so, we almost double the revenue we
do with them. So I think no one will argue one sec that we are the de facto standard in this industry.
Now if we move to Life Sciences. It's also an interesting thing. The use of the data in AI is becoming also mainstream. There is no one
single day where we are not receiving a call from sponsors, whatever it's biotech of large pharma asking us to get access to the set of
data we have in order to do synthetic control arms or to use this as a way to improve the design of the trial, also to select the site. So
there are many, many different use cases we have developed on top of it.
We are also developing in parallel what we call the synthetic patients, which is nothing more than building algorithms with very high
accuracy in order to predict adverse events without having to test physically the products. And Verastem is again a good example of
this. They are selecting the synthetic control arm for rare disease in oncology. And again, why it's important, you have the traditional
benefit of it, which is to maximize, to accelerate innovations, to reduce the cost, and to mitigate the risk profile of the trials. But the
more important is, as you may know, for rare diseases, it's extremely difficult to enroll patients. It's very, very, very difficult. And
for many of them, if you give the standard of care, to a certain extent, you are not delivering the promise, which is to come with
innovative therapeutics on the market. So using this synthetic control is really a way to ensure the patients have access to the most
promising treatments. That's what is behind of this.
Same thing if we step back and we look at the footprint on the market. We just issued a press release a few weeks ago about 13,000
clinical trials and 9 million participants in those trials having used our solutions. It's really a milestone for the industry. It's really a
milestone. Whatever the competition is claiming, they are only touching a fraction of the footprint we have established in the market.
It was built on, obviously we are not alone, we did it with all the customers and the partners, but I think it's a demonstration that our
ability to come on a regular basis with a flow of innovation, and we are really the one virtualizing these industries. And the proof of
what I'm saying is, look, 75 of the new drugs approved last year have been developed with MEDIDATA and BIOVIA, 75%.
So again, no one will argue that we are also the de facto standard in this industry. And I want to take the opportunity also to thank the
9 million trial participants, because I think they are helping us to advance the journey and also the patient diversity, which is a big
topic for the trial.
Now if we move to Infrastructure & Cities, when we are saying to you we are a purpose-driven company, it's not only for the
marketing or to only have a nice story to tell. It is a proof. By the way, if you have 2 minutes, go on our website and look at what
-- we have a different commitment we took. One of them is act for water and consumptions. You will see, it's very interesting. You
have all the programs we have launched in order to basically treat the water as a precious resource. And why it's a precious resource,
because you know that in 2025, almost 2/3 of the population may face water shortage already. And one way to contribute to this is, for
example, this example. Ecolab.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL  APR 26, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7It's a company developing water treatments, if you want, detergents. And in fact, what they do, they are using all of our solutions,
especially the deep science solutions in order to reformulate their products to consume less water. At the same time, we are managing
the different regulatory which is a big constraint globally. And obviously, they are fostering the collaboration across the multiple
entire lifecycle products. Why so? Because they serve many, many industries. Those detergents are used by the Life Sciences, by the
Aerospace, Transportation and Mobility, the Food and Beverage as well. And being capable to touch those companies, it's really a
way to have an impact on the society. So again, an example.
Now if we zoom on the operational performance and the few comments we can do. Let's start with Americas. Americas is growing
6%. The good result is coming really from the mainstream. I think you remember the mainstream was flattish the last half of the year.
Now we start to see the rebound. And we are also seeing good momentum in the pipeline, specifically in Life Sciences, Aerospace
and High Tech. And you should not be surprised by the way to see High Tech and Life Sciences contributing more and more to the
pipeline. Why so? Because they are the ones spending the most in research and development anyway, so. But I think we knew we had
a good Q4 in Americas. We were expecting to have a slow start in Americas, and we do expect to have an acceleration in the coming
quarters.
Europe, extremely resilient, as you can see, plus 12%. It's really coming from the large engagement we have with many companies in
Europe, especially in France and the south part of Europe, and is driven by Transportation, Mobility and Aerospace. And clearly, we
are extremely proud of what we have been able to accomplish in a region of the world where almost the industry is facing most of the
problems, right?
Asia, minus 3%, and as Bernard stated in the opening comment, it's really coming from China. China is down 8%. And you remember
last year, it was growing at 20%. So the base comparison is not helping, but we have good reasons to believe that we will have the
rebound starting Q2. Why so? Because we saw in March an acceleration and the pipeline is relatively strong. So I think we are
confident that we will be able to catch up.
India is growing double digits, and it's an interesting country, by the way. We are seeing more and more investments flowing into
India. And to a certain extent, in the geopolitics environment, they are the one benefiting from the situation right now. And as you
may know, we have a significant footprint in India. So I think we're extremely pleased with the results we have been able to achieve.
Looking from a product line standpoint, let's start with Industrial Innovations, which is still the core of what we do, plus 4%.
Here, there are 2 messages. The first one, the subscription is up double digits for CATIA and ENOVIA, which basically means
progressively our core industry are moving to subscriptions.
The second takeaway is SIMULIA and NETVIBES are growing double digits. I mean it's a good performance for this quarter. And
it's important because this is a domain where we are still facing competitions, and now you have the proof that we are still winning
against them.
Life Sciences software, plus 11%, driven by MEDIDATA up 13%. So again, we continue to deliver with MEDIDATA and the
pipeline is good. Mainstream Innovation, plus 4%. So the SOLIDWORKS is up single digits. Again, we had a strong base comparison
because last year in Q1 was growing at more than 10%. And this is where most of the impact in China is visible. However, I think we
have more and more traction from Centric PLM. And why so? Because I think we start to leverage not only the leadership position we
have established, but also the diversification strategy. And let me give you some highlights on this.
So first of all, it's 12,500 brands which are already equipped, which is by far the largest footprint on the market. And we are
convinced, if you do the market size, this business could reach EUR 1 billion at some point of time. Why so? Because we are
expanding from the fashion and apparel to new markets such as food and beverage, cosmetic and personal care, home and furniture,
consumer electronics. Those are sizable markets we can touch with the core modules we have developed, which is the collection
management. For all the fast-moving goods, I think Centric PLM is the standard now on the market.
We are also expanding from -- usually, we used to target the brands, and now we are expanding also to the retails and to the
manufacturers and the consumer tomorrow, we can touch with it. That's the second axis to diversify. From a geo standpoint, since the
acquisition, we have reinforced significantly the footprint of Centric in Asia, especially China also, where they just started when we
merged with them.
From a product standpoint, I think it's important. The collection management is really the core, but more and more, we see customers
using them as the business platform. And why? Because this is becoming the backbone for the e-commerce. If you have the product
essentials, if you know how to put dynamic pricing in it, and you -- remember, we did some acquisitions into it, you are becoming the
foundation for many e-commerce activities, and this is how we're expanding with Centric.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL  APR 26, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8So again, Centric will contribute also to accelerate the growth this year, starting Q2, right? So I think it's time for me to hand over to
Rouven to give more flavor on the revenue, the profitability, and the 2023 objectives. Thank you.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Good morning, everybody, and thank you also from my side for joining our call and today's meeting. As you heard from Bernard
and Pascal, we had a solid start to the year. We had a solid Q1 performance as we remained focused on the fundamentals of our
business model, which is increasing the share of predictable revenue with strong growth in subscription and Cloud, up 14% and 17%,
respectively, while at the same point delivering on our profitability objectives.
The total revenue grew 8% as reported and 7% at constant currency and is in line with our objectives. And it's also relative to a high
comparison base of Q1 last year.
Recurring revenue was up 10% and now represents 84% of Software revenue. And now adding to the strong fundamentals, we
generated this quarter a record high in cash from operations, which is up 24%, which was actually up EUR 783 million. And as
expected, we are now deleveraged nearly 1 year ahead of the schedule. And clearly, this highlights our trusted customer relationships,
the value we deliver, and the discipline as well when it comes to spending and our capital allocation policy.
And as you heard from Bernard and Pascal, our long-term structural growth drivers across the industries, they remain intact and
strong. As such, we continue to invest in hiring. We added more than 300 net new employees in the first quarter, while, as I
mentioned, we continue to deliver on our profitability objectives with diluted earnings per share of EUR 0.28 and the operating margin
at 31%, both in line with our objectives.
Now let's look at our results in a little bit more detail. First, for Software revenue, we are up 6% at constant currency, slightly below
the objective range. And this was due to the lower contribution from upfront licenses, which was down minus 10%. Remember, this is
compared to already a guidance at the low end of minus 7%.
Now this shortfall between minus 7% and minus 10% can be fully attributed to the lower-than-expected performance we experienced
in China. As we've discussed over the previous quarter, the operating environment there has been difficult over several quarters. And
to recap, we experienced a soft performance in the second half of 2022 during the lockdown period, where software revenue growth
was around 3% to 4%, and the license revenue was about flattish over that time frame. And this was our baseline assumption that
the growth in China would remain muted in Q1, in line with this trend, while we were expecting and are expecting a progressive
recovery throughout the remainder of the year. Now Q1 turned out to be much lower at minus 8% in software revenue growth in
China. And more specifically, in the first 2 months of the quarter, as the economy and the production cycles were preparing the restart,
the investment levels in innovation and science remained rather muted and low. And this lag contributed 3 to 4 points of growth to the
license mix.
Only in March, investments in innovation started to return, materializing in our pipeline. And while we remain focused, we believe
that this progressive trend is raising the potential and is giving us the confidence to the recovery in the rest of the year in China.
Now on to Service revenue. It was a strong quarter, up 21%, and it was driven by the completion of milestones as well as outcome-
based service engagements, mainly in Life Sciences. And here, we're seeing a few biotechs who are turning to MEDIDATA to deliver
end-to-end study build services with the purpose of accelerating the patient enrollment and the time to market. And while we continue
to shape this offering, we do expect the trend for professional services to normalize throughout the rest of the year.
As mentioned, recurring revenue rose 10% to 84% of total software revenue, and this is up a strong 310 basis points year-over-year.
And also, as mentioned, this growth was driven by good and strong acceleration in Subscription revenue, up 14% versus 10% a year
ago. So consequently, the increasing share of predictable revenue provides us greater visibility and resiliency. And our strategic
growth drivers of 3DEXPERIENCE and Cloud are at the center of the shift to the subscription acceleration.
And as highlighted by the customer examples presented by Pascal, clients, both incumbents transforming and new entrants disrupting
are adopting 3DEXPERIENCE and Cloud. and they are leveraging the full potential of our technologies to increase agility, scale
and accelerate innovation and growth. So 3DEXPERIENCE revenue grew 10% at constant currency, and it now reflects 31% of
3DEXPERIENCE addressable software revenue, which is up 1 point relative to last year. And the Cloud revenue rose 17% at constant
currency, to now 24% of Software revenue, which represents an increase of 3 points. And we are confident that we will continue to
capitalize on our leading position in key industries and capturing above-market growth with 3DEXPERIENCE and Cloud.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL  APR 26, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9So now let's turn to how we performed relative to the objectives we set for the first quarter. The total revenue of EUR 1.434 billion
was EUR 3 million higher than the midpoint of our target range. We reported software revenue of EUR 1.288 billion, which is up 6%
and EUR 25 million below the midpoint and EUR 10 million below the low end of the guidance.
We expect to recapture this gap throughout the remainder of the year, and I will discuss this further in the objective section. As
mentioned, this shortfall was driven by the decline in software revenue in China, which explains the gap to the low end of the software
revenue range or 1 point of growth. We reported service revenue above the midpoint by EUR 11 million, which essentially offsets the
gap at the total revenue level. We benefited from an FX impact of EUR 17 million during the period. We reported an operating margin
of 31%, in line with the objective. And it is clear from the numbers we delivered on our profitability objectives, while we continue to
invest in hiring during the quarter. And as we look to the remainder of the year, we will continue to take a disciplined and balanced
approach as we continue to invest for the future.
As such, we also expect the overall OpEx increase to slowdown, highlighting the fact that we are on track to absorb the cost run rate
from 2022 carrying forward into 2023.
Now turning to earnings per share. We reported EUR 0.28 as reported, well aligned with our objective range of EUR 0.27 to EUR
0.28. The non-IFRS tax rate for the quarter was 20.7% and is also well-aligned with our guidance of 21%.
Now turning to cash flow and balance sheet items. As you see, cash and cash equivalents were strong. They totaled EUR 3.468 billion
compared to EUR 2.769 billion at the end of 2022, which represents an increase of EUR 699 million. At the end of the quarter, our net
financial position totaled EUR 459 million, which is an increase of EUR 686 million versus a net financial debt of EUR 227 million at
December 31 last year. We are now deleveraged, nearly 1 year ahead of schedule.
Now let's look at what is driving our cash position at the end of the first quarter. The operating cash flow increased 24% to EUR 783
million, and this is a record result. And as expected, strong collections in Q1 contributed to a favorable change in operating working
capital of EUR 350 million. And the operating cash flow was mainly used for CapEx of EUR 33 million and the repayment of lease
liabilities of EUR 25 million, which is slightly up versus last year.
Lastly, of note, we had a negative FX impact of EUR 44 million during the first quarter.
Now let's turn to our fiscal year 2023 objective. We are maintaining our guidance. That's the key takeaway, and we are well-
positioned and are on a good trajectory to achieve our long-term financial objective of EUR 1.20 earnings per share. Total revenue
growth between 8% to 9% at constant currency remains unchanged and is adjusted in absolute terms only for the favorable FX impact,
which is EUR 17 million to a range now of EUR 5.940 billion to EUR 5.990 billion. And this, as I mentioned before, assumes that we
expect a positive impact driven by an increase in contribution from large deals in our pipeline starting to materialize in Q2.
We also expect to return to low mid-single-digit growth in China and also throughout the year, further progression as more and more
investments are directed towards innovation and science. And finally, we reaffirm our operating margin range of 32.3% to 32.6%.
Before I move to the Q2 objectives, I would like to emphasize that the unchanged full year revenue guidance assumes that we
maintain our growth rate at constant currency for software revenue at 8% to 9% and service revenue of 5% to 7%. We also continue to
expect recurring revenue growth of 10% to 11% with strong subscription revenue increasing in the range of 17% to 18%. And in spite
of the lower performance in upfront license revenue in Q1, we remain confident for the full year in the range of 2% to 5%.
Now let's turn to our Q2 objectives. We are targeting total revenue growth of 7% to 9% at constant currency, with recurring revenue
increasing 9% to 10%. And it's driven by strong subscription growth of 16% to 18%. We are forecasting upfront license revenue
growth of 0% to 5% for the quarter. This reflects structurally improving pipeline, assuming 3 elements: one, an acceleration in North
America; two, continued momentum in Europe across key industries, and three, return to mid-single-digit growth in China with the
benefit of a lower baseline effect.
For services revenue, we are predicting a normalized 6% to 8% growth. In terms of profitability, we are forecasting operating margin
of 30% to 30.5% and diluted EPS of EUR 0.27 to EUR 0.28.
Now let me conclude. We had a solid start to 2023 with well-aligned fundamentals, supported by our strategic growth drivers of
3DEXPERIENCE and Cloud. Our first quarter results demonstrate that our technologies have never been more relevant and critical
for our clients as strongly evidenced in Europe. We are focused on execution to deliver sustainable growth across geographies
throughout the year. And as such, we remain confident in our ability to advance towards our EPS objective of EUR 1.20.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL  APR 26, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11Question and Answer
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
We'll start with a question from the room. So...
Mohammed Essaji Moawalla
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
Just you talked about some of the factors underpinning your confidence around to the second half, you also kind of alluded to some
sort of larger transactions in the pipeline. Maybe if you could sort of talk to how you've kind of qualified the pipeline? Is there
anything different you have done given obviously what you sort of observed in China. And to the extent that you can comment on
the discussions with customers around some of those larger standardization deals. These have obviously been fluctuating a bit, but it
seems that sort of spending and specifically around digitization is still pretty resilient. So what's your kind of view around the drivers
of some of those standardization deals? And if there's any that you can point to?
The second one was just on the comment, obviously, you've delevered sooner than expected. Perhaps you can kind of remind us
around your kind of strategic priorities. I know that you're kind of looking at multiple fronts. And in terms of the discussions you're
having with sort of sellers, is valuation no longer an issue? Has there been a correction and what are the kind of stumbling blocks or
the challenges around perhaps executing on the M&A pipeline?
Bernard S. Charles
Chairman & CEO
Pascal, maybe on the customer conversation, just for -- thank you for the question. Clearly, as you said, all government meetings we
have with large customers say, it's on the agenda. It's priority #1 for them, because they need to find new answers to supply chain
moving to value chain. They need to find new answers for material substitution. Those are reality today. In Europe, it's REACH. We
should not underestimate those kind of challenges for the clients. The nature of the portfolio themselves, electrification is becoming
an obvious case. People had light understanding of it 5 years ago. Today, it's a reality, but also in Infrastructure, more modular
construction, or of course, the new challenge of energy sector.
So the conversation, if I look at 40 years' perspective, I think it has never been at the highest level as of today in terms of a topic on
the CEO's agenda. Before it was the VP of R&D or the VP of Manufacturing. It is becoming a CEO topic. And it's not related to
ChatGPT. It's related to how to transform their business. So I think the Chairman, Pascal, wants me to spend more time with those
guys. I love it, as you do know, after years. But your question is a very important one because the ownership of the topic is evolving
those days. It's not anymore the CIO for at least what we do. Pipeline, Pascal, you are a specialist.
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
So when we started the year, we told you that the pipeline anyway was backloaded, especially in the U.S., where, as you may know,
most of the large transactions are coming from. So just we confirm that's the case. Given China, I think we have much better visibility,
and there are multiple factors. One of them is, as Rouven was saying, the priority for China was really to relaunch the manufacturing
capacity in order to serve the consumer market. Now we start to see innovations and industrial investments being the topic for many
of our customers. That's point #1. Point #2, for many state-owned company, who are also large customers for us, they were awaiting
the reelection before to take any very deep decision or having a huge engagement and commitment for the future. So those are behind
us. And I think we have good visibility on many, many transactions, which are sizable, and we make the difference and earnout gains.
The differences we have on the license, it's almost a EUR 10 million plus. It will be easy to recover. I think we have enough visibility
to tell you that it will be done.
Related to the priority for the M&A. Again, let's say this way, we never failed because we were not capable to convert on the
valuations in any discussion we had in the past. Why so? Because if you have a good strategic framework, if the people, the founders
or the managers wants to do it, we always find a common ground. But when a company is for sale, it's also because the management
start to feel the limit of what they do, right? And for some of them, they need to feel the pressure before to take the decision to take
another road. So to a certain extent, the current situation is helping us much more on this side than the pure valuation side, let's say it
this way. That's what I can say.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL  APR 26, 2023
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12From a priority standpoint, remember, the framework for the M&A has been architected along 3 legs. One is to complement the
domain of expertise and we still have some where we could reinforce. Supply chain, for example, is one of them. Continue to expand
from an industry standpoint. I was mentioning that Centric is becoming a platform to address the consumer market at large, and there
are many things we can build around it, and we will continue to do this. And Bernard shared with you the loop. We spent 40 years
to focus on the innovation cycle. We want now to be a significant player in the product in use and I think this is opening also a new
thought process on our side to consider different type of targets. That's what I can say at this stage.
Adam Dennis Wood
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Adam Wood from Morgan Stanley. Just maybe a quick follow-up to Mo's question. You mentioned big deals quite a lot in the
comments. Is there unusual reliance on big deals in the pipeline? Or is it just a normal kind of exposure? That was the first one.
SOLIDWORKS it feels like that's been running a little bit slower for a few quarters. And I guess you've commented on Centric being
strong, so that would suggest SOLIDWORKS is a bit weaker. The pickup there is that macro dependent, partner training dependent,
China dependent? Just help us on why we should see acceleration on that side?
And maybe finally, just to come back on that point around the product in use side. In terms of collecting the data and then feeding it
into the platform to be able to inform what you do on the design side. Is that a partnership? We always have the discussion around IoT
and being able to collect data. Is that something that you feel now is more central to you? You're still very comfortable to partner for
that to be able to cap that data and get it into the platform?
Bernard S. Charles
Chairman & CEO
So I start with the large deal, and maybe Rouven, you can say a few words about SOLIDWORKS, if you want? No, the large deals, I
think we had a good Q4, right? But as you know, when we have a good Q4, it's usually because of we close large transactions, and we
did most of them, especially in the U.S. in Q4. So we knew when we came to you with the guidance that Q1 will be light in terms of
significant transactions. Significant means for us 10 million strikes, that's what it means.
Nevertheless, if I look at the pipelines in 2023 compared to 2022, the mix is equivalent. I mean there is no discrepancy between the
size of the deals compared to what we have seen in 2022. Obviously, it's much better than what we used to have in 2020, right, at the
time of the COVID. And it is true across all the regions of the world. I mean, the large transactions are not only a new logo, right?
They are also significant customers continuing to deploy. And I was mentioning Ford. Ford, we are just opening, right? The fact that
they are adopting the 3DEXPERIENCE platform means ultimately, they will connect not only the design, but the simulation, the
manufacturing. And it's not only for the product design, for the vehicle design, it's also for the battery designs and the Gigafactory
topic will be also on the agenda. So to a certain extent, this is a route to expand significantly. And this is how we fulfill the machine
with the large transactions. SOLIDWORKS?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes. On the SOLIDWORKS side, you're right, Adam, SOLIDWORKS has had an impact on the macro in 2022. And we were
referring to that, that there's a connection, but the good news is, in the first quarter, we saw actually a very good uptick in our pipeline
and performance in March. So we expect the SOLIDWORKS contribution and growth to progressively increase throughout the year.
And please also keep in mind that Q1 last year, it was a very, very strong quarter. And so the comparison was tough. Nevertheless, we
delivered growth in SOLIDWORKS. And that's because the momentum picked up in March, and we expect the trend to be positive to
continue in Q2.
Bernard S. Charles
Chairman & CEO
Coming back to under the umbrella of IoT. In fact, a lot of our existing customers have collected massive data that they have never
used. I think few real examples in aerospace engines, for example. They have all the records, all of them. They basically never used
it. We did amazing program with Safran to really reveal through NETVIBES, AI, data science, the health of each engine, and it works
very well.
So the first message is there is a big discussion on IoT, but there are a lot of data which have not been used. The same goes with
airplane health, like massive data related to the maintenance of the airplane, different characteristics of parts evolution. Now we see
customers coming back to us and say, can you help integrate those excel files, those data records in a way where they can be projectedDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL  APR 26, 2023
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 13against the virtual twin of the plane, the engine or something else. We have done it. It's a real showcase. We have a big showcase also
in equipment availability, especially in A&D. We have a big program on that to do predictive maintenance. It has been a topic on the
agenda, but very little has been done in the reality of things.
And if you look at EVs and new cars, they are connected. There is much more records. Before there were basically no records. You
could not basically load the data that you had in your car. But now it's going the other way around and it provides a completely
different view to the way things have been engineered and produced. So I think IoT isolated will not solve the problem. We can solve
the problem. And that's why the EXPERIENCE platform being able to massively connect the dots, we call this connect the dots.
We did it for Renault, we did it for Gulfstream. We did it for -- when I say we did it, we did it already in operation for Jaguar Land
Rover. We did it for Dassault Aviation. So we have enough proof points now. And we need, as Pascal implied, we need to set up the
evolution of our sales team to really engage on that side, because those are different decision-makers.
Related to IoT, and not to take too much time on this, but it's this real life experimentation is a very core one. I think it's a bigger
market than the one we have been serving up to now personally. And when you think about a clinical trial, it's on the right side, not
the left. It's because we observe what's happening to people. You create AI to reveal what is not observed by human, and you conclude
about the value and the risk to really do precision medicine. So MEDIDATA is a proof point at scale that in those 2 spirals, the one on
the right side related to real life experimentation, it's called real-world evidence. So we are not taking an IoT approach, we are talking
a real world evidence approach. We are applying biologic to physical world, and yes, cooperation, of course.
Frederic Emile Alfred Boulan
BofA Securities, Research Division
Fred with Bank of America. If we can get a quick update on Cloud demand appetite from customers, tractions you're seeing on
3DX, what type of upsell metrics we can discuss? And then back in Q3, you said some of the impact on licenses were due to some
customers shifting to subscription contracts. Is it something we've seen to a degree in Q1? And what do we expect for the rest of the
year?
Bernard S. Charles
Chairman & CEO
Okay. So the Cloud for us, you remember, more than ever, it's a way to expand the footprint. In our strategy, what we call the value up
and the value wide, the value up is really how we increase the total value of the solutions, and the value wide is how we continue to
conquest new domains, new users we cannot reach with the current system we have in place. And I think the real value for the Cloud
is this. It's, come with new proposal to reach new users you are not able to equip with the traditional way. That's the primary objective
for us. So this is the reason why, on the management side, we spend more attention on how many new logos we continue to win, what
is the usage of those solutions on the cloud, how many content, how many activities they do, which are the real KPIs we are tracking.
Why? Because if this is happening, the revenue will follow, right? That's the right sequence.
Now having said that, from an industry standpoint, it's easier to start when we do not have a legacy, so for all the new industry,
whatever it's Life Sciences, the Consumer Goods, Consumer Packaged Goods; to a certain extent, Infrastructure & Cities,
Construction for sure, we start from day 1 with Cloud. That's point number one. Point number two, for all the industries which are
project-based, it's extremely relevant to use the Cloud, because this is giving the people the flexibility. The project is starting, but at
the end, not sure they will have another project. And to a certain extent, you can see the trial like this there is a start and there is an
end.
So this flexibility to connect different people each time is extremely valuable for those industries. So clearly, Life Sciences,
Construction is one of them, the Design offices are also the one adopting massively the Cloud. All the start-ups, right, whatever
is the sector, I mean, they start with the Cloud. Time to time, believe it or not, we have to shift from the Cloud to on-prem for
regulations and compliance reasons. For example, if you develop systems to fly and transport people, at some point of time, you need
a certification.
And then you need to certify not only the object, but the tools, the processes, the people, the entire systems. And if you come with the
Cloud with the regular updates, this is becoming so much trouble, because you need to freeze, for certain times, the entire systems to
get the certifications. So why I'm taking this as an anecdote, because we started with a very innovative company, adopting the Cloud
for all the reasons you know. But when you start to scale, when you start to become industrial, you face different set of constraints and
the ability to, again, offer the mix environment is extremely valuable for many of our customers.
The last comment I can make on the Cloud, we start to -- for the vast majority of our large customers, they have a road map to move
to the Cloud, right? Obviously, it's not something they can do overnight. It's 5 to 10 years road map. And we are one of the players,DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL  APR 26, 2023
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 14I mean helping them to craft this road map and to make it happen. I mean, Renault is a good case. They had a huge legacy on our
systems, and we are moving them to the cloud. We started with some programs. We started with some specific use cases, again,
and progressively, everything is moving smoothly. So I think what is probably behind your question, are we on track to deliver the
commitment we have to have the EUR 2 billion revenue, I think we are. We are.
Frederic Emile Alfred Boulan
BofA Securities, Research Division
Yes. The second question was about subscription in Q1...
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
No. I think the -- again, it's obvious that the subscription is growing faster than the license, but it's not repurpose of an existing
installed base, we are moving to subscriptions. It's much more new program, new projects or extension of existing programs, which
are moving to subscriptions. You have different -- I mean, there are differences from a geo to another one. it's becoming almost a
standard in the U.S. The vast majority of the new programs, the new projects are subscription-based. It's balanced in Europe. And in
Asia, it's an exception for the vast majority of the countries. So this is where we are.
Again, it's not something dictated by the customer. because we still have many industries willing to keep a CapEx-based approach.
And that's the reason why I can claim that the upfront license model will not disappear completely. Remember, it used to be 30% of
the total revenue. Now it's 16%. And we are pretty convinced we will land at around 10%, right? And not go below 10%, at least for a
certain time. That's what I can say.
Charles Brennan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division
It's Charlie Brennan here from Jefferies. Just 2 questions from me. Firstly, a high-level one. It sounds like you spent more time talking
about the medium-term positioning today than maybe in normal presentations. If I'm being critical, you've maybe underperformed
the growth potential that it feels like there is in Dassault. What do you think the gating factor is to get Dassault back to sustainable
double-digit growth? Is there some license to subscription dilution? Is it possible that market shares can be too high? If you've got an
85% market share, does that limit your growth? Do you need to invest more in sales? Do you need to lower your margin to capture it?
What's the high-level driver to get this business to sustainable double-digit growth?
And then secondly, just a modeling question. You did 14% subscription growth in Q1. It looks like you're targeting 17% in Q2. We're
used to see subscriptions driving recurring revenues. Getting a 3-point acceleration in growth in a recurring revenue business is quite
challenging. Is there more point in time revenue recognition coming into that business model?
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Okay. So I will start with the first question. It's a valid question, by the way. I accept it. But remember, it's only Q1. I think the
question will be valid at the end of the year, If I may. Last year, I remember, in Q3, you asked almost the same questions. And finally,
we landed properly. So if you look at the fundamentals of the business, we are not constrained by the size of the market, right? It's
obvious. It's already EUR 100 billion. And with the extension we do, as Bernard was stating, it's a factor of the multiplications.
We are not constrained also by the penetration of our installed base. We still have a lot to do, and I have many proof points I shared
with you over the last few quarters where in, for example, transportation and mobility, in large account, you were convinced we were
set and we have been able to double the size. We are not yet also constrained on the on the ability to cover the market. I think having a
direct sales approach and an indirect sales approach is giving a lot of room to foster the coverage of the market.
So if you look at all those things, frankly speaking, there is no limitation. Now the competition, and I'm glad you come back to this
topic. Because again, I saw some research coming -- whatever, it's by the way coming from the financial industry, also from the
specialists, where I think they have a hard time to compute the numbers. And why so? Because I think the definition of the market
is not the same. That's probably where the trick is coming. But I can guarantee to you that the winning rates we are facing in all the
product lines we have in all the verticals is exceeding 80%.
I mean it's something we are monitoring precisely and that's really the case. So there may be some domain or subsegment of the
market we are not covering properly. That's probably the reason why others continue to expand, but the competitiveness is not at
stake. So, I think execution, that's where we are focusing right now, and to a certain extent, I like having, let's say, a year which isDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL  APR 26, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15backloaded, because this is putting a lot of pressure on the quality of the execution, if you want to deliver at the end of the year. That's
my duty. I am accountable for that, and I think the management team knows it. And this is clearly the focus.
Now why we are speaking about much more the midterm. We have the Capital Markets Day coming, right? And usually, we know
that if we come with the story only once, it's not enough. We have to repeat. And Bernard is starting to tease it, right? That's what he's
doing.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Okay. And to your question on the subscription growth, I think first, to make sure to clarify, everything that is onetime related is not
part of the subscription revenue line item, right? It's in Software and other license and other revenue. So the upfront component moves
to the license and other component. And when you think about the acceleration in recurring, it's always a function of the timing of
renewals of existing transactions as well as new transactions, right? We renewed in Q1. That will have an impact to Q2. And we also
have sizable transactions in Q2 that are incremental and new, so that's where the acceleration is coming from.
Michael Briest
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Michael Briest from UBS. Just 2 quick ones. So on the cloud growth of 17%, obviously, it's deceleration. Pascal, you said you're
going to hit the EUR 2 billion, you need to grow over 20%. So can you talk about the dynamics of when that will accelerate? And
maybe specifically on MEDIDATA 2 quarters at 13% growth, the midterm ambition is 13% to 15%. Can we get back into the upper
end of that corridor anytime soon?
And then maybe just a sort of preamble to the CMD, I remember [ Tibo ] a few years ago had a slide showing the lifetime value
equivalents between License, Subscription, Cloud. Can you just refresh where we are on maybe a 3-year value, if you like, between
them as prices have moved around and mix has moved around.
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Okay. So you're right to achieve the EUR 2 billion. The CAGR should be up 20%, but from quarter to another one, you have some
volatility anyway. I mean you have some seasonality topic also. Now if you look at the performance, where I'm very pleased, if we
are growing at 17% and MEDIDATA is growing, to be precise, at 13.5%, right? It means that the rest is growing much faster. And
to a certain extent, the most important for us is the growth of the rest. So I'm very pleased with the traction we have with ENOVIA. I
mean ENOVIA is really moving to the Cloud, Subscription and Cloud at the same time. And why so? Because again, it's a way for us
to reach people which are not equipped, not having a deep usage of all the set of applications we do. I mean, sometimes we have some
casual users we need to connect into the product life cycle. And we have a collection of application for that.
CATIA is also moving to the Cloud definitively with all the newcomers and the Tesla of the world, the BIOD of the world, they
used to be small 10 years ago, now they have large engineering departments and many of them are on the Cloud. And now we start
to see also the traction coming from this front. So clearly, most is coming from the newcomers and also the transition of some large
customers we are orchestrating over the time.
MEDIDATA, I think, again, the performance of MEDIDATA is coming from different things, the number of trials, price. So the
number of trials is still growing. We do not have any more of the extra growth coming from the COVID. But nevertheless, the trend is
still at 6% to 7%, which is good. And we are capturing most of it, which is probably the most important.
The second thing is the ability to expand outside of the core product, which is Rave, and the 2 flagship products for us are really
AI on one hand and Patient Cloud on the other hand. And both are becoming mainstream. I mean if you look at the attach rates, it's
extremely high.
And the third piece is the renewal. So the renewal is extremely important because for the large enterprise, the way it works, usually,
we have a contract for multiple years. And the renewal is the time to uplift the value up. Last year, we didn't have too much renewal.
This year, we have a lot of renewal, which gives us the ability -- and in average, when we do a renewal, the uplift is around 20%
to 25%. So by doing so, to a certain extent, we are fulfilling the bookings and you will start to see also the benefit of it in the
MEDIDATA performance.
The last point is, the Life Sciences revenue is not only related to MEDIDATA. The other part is also starting to take a significant
piece. BIOVIA, I think we are starting to reach the end of the transition to subscription. And the pipeline is good for BIOVIA.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL  APR 26, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16We are not yet at the level of the transaction we want. There are still small and midsized transactions. It's probably due to the nature of
the market itself. However, we have large transactions coming from DELMIA and ENOVIA in this field. And this is very important
for the future.
And again, remember when we did the acquisition of MEDIDATA, it was not to have a coexistence of the business. It's to link with
the rest of what we do. And now I have been engaged personally with at least many discussions where this is a topic. This is really the
topic. And why it's the topic, it's because, believe it or not, this industry, the process is broken. I mean, there are so many, many pieces
of software they are using in order to connect and they spend their life to connect them in order to have workflows. Now they have to
understand the difference between the workflows and the single source of tools. And this is happening. This is really happening.
So pretty confident for MEDIDATA for sure and the Life Science at large.
Bernard S. Charles
Chairman & CEO
And Michael, to the lifetime value. I think the theory would suggest that the breakeven point is somewhere between 3 to 4 years.
The reality, though, is, in our situation, where, as I said before, the shift to subscription is really happening to the 3DEXPERIENCE
adoption. And that is a multiplier of deal size in terms of value up opportunity, that in many, many cases, deal sizes are actually
increasing and are much larger as we are moving to subscription 3DEXPERIENCE-based compared to a traditional license
transaction, right, of a client who was using V5 before. So we've made a lot of progress on this transition. We talked about all the
customers today our 3DEXPERIENCE based, and so we see that acceleration in terms of the value of opportunity and potential.
So yes, our standard pricing models have the breakeven between years 3 and year 4, but the reality is that we are exceeding that
in most of the cases, because we're able to expand from a value proposition and an adoption standpoint. And another example for
MEDIDATA, for example, when you compare it to its already established SaaS Cloud opportunity, for most of the enterprise contracts
that we renew, as Pascal was saying before, on average, we are increasing the rate compared to the baseline by 25%. We just renewed
with a top 5, top 10 Life Sciences sponsor. And we've almost doubled the deal size because we were able to value up significantly.
So that's really the strategy, it's to bring, adopt and expand to more users, expand along our platform, and with this, drive higher
contribution to growth outside, I would say, the traditional breakeven model.
Michael Briest
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
And Cloud relative to license...
Bernard S. Charles
Chairman & CEO
Yes, cloud relative to license. It really depends on the deployment, right, and the size. But typically, it was at 3 to 4 years on a like-for-
like basis.
And the multiplier effect that you say is for 3DEXPERIENCE platform is a minimum of 2x, and with the Cloud it is 1.5x. So if you
move to 3DEXPERIENCE platform on the cloud and subscriptions, right, have the benefit of the 3 levers, if you want. That's the
strategy.
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
We will now take 1 or 2 questions from the call.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question. The first question comes from the line of James Goodman from Barclays.
James Arthur Goodman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Just on the discussion around China and Asia. I mean, I wasn't entirely clear. I mean, Asia, I think, is about 10 points lower growth
than Q4. I might be off a bit on the China weighting within that, but it looks like there was some broader weakness across APAC.
So maybe you could clarify. And just within China, I mean, the discussion we've been having for a few quarters has been almost
exclusively around the SOLIDWORKS distribution in China. Was it a broader product issue this time around?DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL  APR 26, 2023
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 17And then the other question is, could you just give a quick update on the adoption around the WORKS family, which you'll talk more
about it at the CMD, but any color on the adoption there and around 3D Creator perhaps would be helpful.
Bernard S. Charles
Chairman & CEO
Okay, James, thank you for your question. I'll address the first one around APAC. Just to clarify, first of all, on the numbers, and then
I go one step further. So APAC, as Pascal presented, it was down minus 3% in Software. China was, in this, minus 8% in Software.
Remember, in Q1 last year, China was up 20%. So it was on a difficult comparable basis. Nevertheless, for the reasons that we've
discussed, right, starting the production, accelerating the consumer cycle, it took a little bit longer to reaccelerate the investments into
innovation. That is the backdrop of the lower performance in China that we see progressively improving.
Now about broader Asia, we referred to the very strong double-digit performance in India and the growing pipeline we see there. It's
a market that is very, very promising to us. There's lots of customer conversation, and we see the growth to continue. So we're very,
very optimistic on this market. Japan and Korea were more flat year-over-year, but also compared to a stronger Q1 of last year. So in
essence, right, the minus 3% in Asia is due to the miss in China, and we expect Asia to return back to mid-single-digit growth when
we return to growth in China, which we're confident to see starting Q2.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Regarding the WORKS family, we continue to expand the portfolio with simulation, manufacturing. Remember the IQMS acquisition
are now making it in WORKS, as well as providing web browser based solutions. More and more start-ups are using browser-based
laptop -- not laptops, tablets to do design. And I think it's working very well. So I think the biggest challenge with the WORKS family
is -- the 3DEXPERIENCE WORK family is to train the resellers who are being used to sell PC-based desktop application called
SOLIDWORKS to really have them being trained to sell the platform for collaboration and sell the platform as a way to expand.
This is probably in the next coming quarters, the biggest topic of attention. We have proof points that certain resellers have done this
transition extremely well, and we have also proof points that there are new resellers that we have hired while doing only cloud-based
3DEXPERIENCE works with efficiency. It's a transition, as Pascal said, for the speed of execution to create a double-digit growth
there. But I'm confident it will happen.
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
Gentlemen, we have to finish here. We have a call this afternoon to take some further questions.
Bernard S. Charles
Chairman & CEO
So thank you very much for all of you participating here in London and all of you connected and we have the call as always, as
Beatrix said, this afternoon. We are always here to answer your questions. Thank you very much and see you, if not this afternoon, at
the CMD on June 9 at The Compass, and the dinner before. Don't forget the dinner. Thank you very much. Have a good day.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL  APR 26, 2023

Operator
Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Dassault Systèmes 2023 Q2 and First Half Earnings Presentation Call and
Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Please, note that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over
to your speaker, Beatrix Martinez, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
Good morning, everyone. This is Beatrix Martinez speaking, Dassault Systèmes VP, Investor Relations. From the company, we have
Bernard Charles, Chairman and CEO; Pascal Daloz, Deputy CEO and COO; and Rouven Bergmann, CFO.
I would like to welcome you to Dassault Systèmes Second Quarter and Half Year 2023 Webcast Presentation. [Operator Instructions]
Later today, we will also hold a conference call. Dassault Systèmes results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. Most of the
financial figures in this conference call are presented on a non-IFRS basis, with revenue growth rates in constant currencies, unless
otherwise noted. For an understanding of the differences between the IFRS and the non-IFRS, please see the reconciliation tables
included in our press release.
Some of the comments we will make during today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements, which could differ
materially from actual results. Please refer to our risk factors in our 2022 document d’enregistrement universel published on March
17.
I will now hand over to Bernard Charles.
Bernard S. Charles
Chairman & CEO
Hello, everyone. This is my 106th quarter, not bad as a record. While we are pleased with this second quarter 2023 with a strong
quarter from 2 perspectives, broad-based, and we see a momentum, may be strange for some of you provided the current indicators of
the economy, but we see -- we do see a momentum and Rouven and Pascal will talk about it.
So the total revenue was up 8%, most importantly, double-digit for the new license when you add the upfront on the subscription. The
operating margin was to 31%. On the headcount, remember, we continued to invest last year, at the end of year, and we have, again,
invested, is up 7%. So we are investing for the future. The EPS up 7%. Excluding exchange rate, it's 15%. So what can we say. Pascal
will have wonderful illustration about the next comments that I want to share with you. First, the move from things to live are working
for us on opening up significant perspective. By the way, I'm sure you have noticed that at our CMD, Capital Market Day, in June,
more to be discussed in years to come, but it's also a foundation for the next 5 years. The virtual twin discipline, the twin of the real is
creating a new milieu where you can experiment and provide experiences when you connect the virtual twin in the real world.
And of course, as everyone is now speaking about AI for text on Symantec and grammar, we are applying for a long time, more than
10 years, AI on science. So AI will play a role, not only for text on grammar, but it will play a big role for science, too. And I'm going
to show you 2 illustrations about that in a moment.
So we are basically combining modeling, how you represent the world; simulation, how you experiment the world; on AI, how you
learn from this new milieu, which is the addition of the replica of reality at a certain level. We call it virtual twin, connecting it to the
data you collect, which are what we call real-world evidence, whether you are in manufacturing industries, energy or life science. So
that's the core of the future of Dassault Systèmes. There is a second aspect of it, which is really the evolution of the world for a more
sustainable industry. And virtual twin is a very key set of capabilities for that on multiple fronts, material transition, process transition
and providing virtual twin as a service is a key for anything to rebuild and redefine the move from value chain to -- from supply chain
to value chain. And of course, it calls for a new workforce, new type of training.
All our customers are talking about the workforce of the future at this point in time. So it's really an expansion where progressively the
virtual world to help to design -- imagine, design, create, produce and operate is connected. And of course, you have seen it already.
We are confirming our full year 2023 objectives, which I'm pleased with the team because we committed for the 5 years' plan. I'm
supposed to be in charge of the -- this conclusion of the 5 years plan, doubling the EPS reaching EUR 1.20. So we said EUR 1.18 to
EUR 1.20. I hope the team will deliver EUR 1.20.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2023 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 25, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 5This being said, coming back to the journey, there are a few things which are important. I think I illustrated to you very precisely why
virtual twin of human is changing life, is changing a lot of things in life science. Not only that, bioscience is going to play a very big
role in food, nutrition, substitution, as you can imagine, as well as even for manufacturing industries. So we are really seeing, on a
longer term, a true metamorphosis of the entire industry of the world.
Let me come back on 2 illustrations. One, launching this video to show you, please look at the people, how they live in an
environment, which is both real and virtual because I was touched. I was moved with this video that you are going to see in the French
hospital Saint-Louis, please run the video.
[Presentation]
Bernard S. Charles
Chairman & CEO
It's always a special moment when you see these kind of capabilities in the real world, and when you see the face of those people
helping to improve the life of others, really taking advantage of those technologies. So I think this echoes very well. What happened
in Boston a few weeks ago, where we had the science in the age of experience. And we had an amazing conference with prestigious
scientific scientists as well as Nobel Prize awarded people talking about the revolution that this will represent. And I think their
presence -- their presentation confirmed that it's becoming very important. Big event, 300-plus number of the global scientific
communities. And of course, this is key because this powerful network is helping us to qualify and define the priorities for this sector.
Another example, because everyone is talking AI, so we want to make sure that people understand that we have been doing it for years
in multiple sectors. That is one example that you know that we have talked about already, which is AI for clinical trial. I will not come
back on that. But as you know, the [indiscernible] arm in clinical trial is really AI-driven, AI-generated for precision medicine clinical
trial.
Here is another example, which is -- I hope the video is running, Beatrix, thank you. This is an example of generative therapeutics
design. What's the problem? You have a target, and you are trying to invent new type of molecules, biologics that could solve -- the
target is of course the disease, that could solve the problem of killing the target or reducing the problem. And with AI, with generative
therapeutic AI, Dassault Systèmes, with the BIOVIA brand, which is really a deep science, has really demonstrated that we can
generate an incredible number of possible options.
Now the next question is, how do you select them? How you reduce the selection field when you have generated so many of those
things?
So do we do simulation? So when you connect data science modeling simulation with AI, you get the new world. And I believe
that what we're presenting here for generative therapeutics is as big as when -- and as important as when Google demonstrated the
unfolding of -- that they did a few years ago, which has not been very much used, but all this is coming to create a new milieu for
the science that will be useful. So generative AI is used widely on very specific domains at Dassault Systèmes, and we know how to
build learning machine on science and data to make it happen. Remember, we also had the showcase a few months ago, I think second
quarter, Pascal, with Renault predicting cost of the vehicle based on material cost volatility on market, and it worked very well.
So this is what I wanted to illustrate. It is an opportunity for us, and we are leveraging it. You are familiar for those of you who have
followed us for numerous years, about this, what we call multiphysics multiscale, starting from atoms going to the end product,
whether it's a plane or car or battery, brain or a heart, you name it, human cell or whatever. So we continue, and we will continue
to invest to do multi-scale multi-discipline with not only material science chemistry but also biology. And we are even redefining
the mass foundation of biology to make sure we have comprehensive models on all those things. And that's really core for Dassault
Systèmes.
So in summary, virtual twin is not the shape of a human. Virtual twin is about representing all aspects, revealing the invisible for
brain, heart, lungs, cells, and we do those things today. We have tangible program on each of them. Skin as well as microbiota, which
are very, very key for the future, by the way, and when you think about the virtualization of this, and you connect it to the real data
connection, you create a new world for partition. You create a new milieu to invent new type of practices and redefine the search. This
is what Dassault Systèmes is doing.
And I could use the same illustration for object flying for Hi-Tec, for energy grid, for moving vehicles, for robots and the similarity
with this architecture will be very, very alike. So this is why I think we have solid foundations for the future, and we will continue to
invest to really make this a reality and value for the world. The purpose is guiding us. It's a generic statement, but I think no one canDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2023 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 25, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 6debate the fact that since February 9, 2012, we have spent a lot of money to make this happen, and we will continue to do so and I
think with the right investment. With that, Pascal, it's your turn.
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Thank you, Bernard. Good morning, everyone. Always a pleasure to be with you at this time of the year. Before to dig a little bit into
the customer example and the split by product line, by geo, let me give you some flavor of what is our perception of what is going on.
My first comment is we saw the renewed focus on investment in innovation from a customer's standpoint.
And this positive shift in the market was relatively evident in our strong performance driven by the broad-based momentum in both
large enterprises, but also in the mid-market across all the geos. And you will see Rouven will give you a lot of numbers to confirm
this.
The second takeaway is the conversions between the experience economy and the circular economy is really driving a deep
transformation across all the sectors. All the businesses, all the industries continue to evolve, and we saw growing demand from our
customers to address those critical issues of sustainability, but also environmental responsibility, maintaining a competitive edge
through rapid innovation and optimizing operational efficiencies.
Now let's zoom on some specific cases. The first 1 is Unilever, and you remember, the circularity is more just than a concept for our
clients. They recognize the tangible benefits of what we bring on the concrete projects. And we are driving forward the sustainability
innovation in manufacturing using AI, as Bernard said, in combination with our virtual twins to minimize the waste and recycle the
raw materials. Remember, 2 quarters ago, I was -- we were speaking about PepsiCo. Now we are speaking about the case of Unilever,
and it's almost the same things. Unilever, they have the bold ambition to reduce the plastic waste with a target of reducing the virgin
plastic by up 50% by 2025.
So to make it happen, and to support these ambitions, they are using the 3DEXPERIENCE platform to drive the material efficiency
through an automated optimized -- optimization processes, which are leveraging the real-world evidence, the combination against of
the AI and the virtual twin. And additionally, with those new plastic bottle design, we are right for the first time.
That's for the manufacturing space. If we zoom in the life sciences, the significant time required and the level of upfront costs and
potential risk involved in clinical development provide barriers, in fact, to innovations in life sciences industry. And we aim to help
to reduce and break down those barriers across the sectors to enable greater innovation. Last quarter, Novartis was expanding its trust
to MEDIDATA. And you know Novartis, we have a long-standing relationship with them. And I think when they are selecting their
partner, they select not only on the value-added, but also the trust and their domain expertise. And I think this is also something which
is unique.
If you look at the landscape, we are one of the few having the therapeutic domain expertise.
So what does it mean? It means we will continue to assist them in achieving a reduction of 50% of the cycle time. But at the
same time, we are also standardizing. We help them to standardize their clinical trial on one unified cloud platform to ensure the
comprehensive life cycle management. And this is key because we are preparing the fact that they will connect the dots to the entire
drug life cycle development. So our commitment to Novartis' success is stronger than ever, and it's evidenced by the expanded
partnership with a new 5-year commitment, and we are dedicating, obviously, to support Novartis in enhancing the patient experience
and driving unprecedented clinical outcome.
Now let's move on infrastructure and cities. The importance of the clean, safe and sovereign energy has always been mission-critical.
And in the recent year, the topic has gained significant attention worldwide, particularly as we transition toward the global carbon-
free energy. While we have frequently showcased the success in energy production, this time, I really want to emphasize how we
can drive the innovation in the domain of the grid. Red Electrica, the sole operator of the Spanish electricity system, has adopted the
3DEXPERIENCE platform on the cloud, not only to design but also to operate the virtual twins of the energy network for the Spanish
generation smart grid.
Operating the virtual twin of their network will ensure a few things. The first one is the highest grid availability while we are
managing various energy sources, but also enable easy grid connections. We are also supporting them in designing the next generation
of reversible hydropower plant for energy storage, which is obviously critical because when you have a lot of renewal, you need to
find a way to store energy. And producing hydrogen and being able to recreate energy from them is extremely powerful.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2023 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 25, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7And last, but not least, we are also assisting them in managing the construction program for the power lines, for the substations and
for the storage facilities at the same time. So with one single platform, with the virtual twin experience, we cannot only help them
to transform the traditional network into a grid, develop the new breakthrough technology, especially in the storage -- in the energy
storage, but also operate real-time this network. So we are really delighted to support Red Electrica and further our partners for the
sustainable energy.
Now let's move to the performance of the Q2. The key trend across the geo and product line I want to highlight. First, let's look at it
by the geos. In Americas, the revenue growth accelerated sequentially to 10%, driven by a strong performance, mainly in Aerospace
& Defense as well as High Tech and well supported by Life Sciences. In Europe, momentum continued, with a revenue growth of 9%,
and the region benefited from a strong strength in Germany and France, mainly driven by consumer-packaged goods and retail and
also transportation and mobility.
In Asia, the revenue growth was 4%, thanks to the rebound in China, with a growth up high single digits and continued high double-
digit growth in India and strength in Mainstream Innovation.
Now turning to the product line performance for the second quarter. Industrial Innovation software revenue saw 7% growth in
Q2. Within that, CATIA delivered double-digit growth in both upfront license and subscriptions, thanks to a strong cyber system
adoption. And you have seen in Bernard's presentation, the cyber system adoption is not only for all the connected objects, but it's also
meaningful for the rest of what we do, including Life Sciences.
SIMULIA also performed well this quarter, with the software revenue growing high single digits during the quarter. And ENOVIA
also delivered a good subscription result during the period. In Life Sciences software, the revenue increased 7%. So MEDIDATA
delivered a high single-digit growth, lower than in the previous quarter, and driven by an industry-wide reduction in study starts when
compared to the very high post-COVID levels as well as on a very strong baseline effect when you compare the second quarter of last
year. And Rouven will come back to this and will give you a lot of details.
But at the same time, and this is where I want to emphasize, we are experiencing a strong performance in the top pharma companies,
including several multiyear renewals such as Novartis, but not only I could mention this quarter also Gilead. Importantly, we plan to
return to double-digit growth before the end of the year for MEDIDATA at large.
Zooming now in Mainstream Innovation. Software revenue increased 12%, and this performance has been achieved with a strong
double-digit growth with a broad-based expansion across all the geo for SOLIDWORKS. Notably in China, where the software
revenue increased by 25%, and remember, it's really a significant rebound because this has to be compared by minus 22% in the first
quarter.
Centric PLM also reported an excellent performance driven by the consumer-packaged goods retail and saw a continued business
momentum across all the core business verticals. And zooming more on the Centric PLM, it's a brand -- it's a collection of solutions,
which is used by 12,500 brands today, has a significant footprint in the market. However, the potential opportunity we see is much
larger. We are progressively moving from fashion and apparel to new markets, including food and beverage, cosmetics, personal care,
home and furniture, consumer electronics, just to name a few of them.
We are also moving from brands, which are the core, to retailers. And remember, one of the largest transactions for this quarter is with
one of the large retailers in Europe, manufacturers, but also more and more consumer. Finally, we are -- from a solution standpoint,
we are also expanding from the collection management to establish a business platform that will serve as a backbone for e-commerce.
I think we are well positioned to continue to execute our strategy and become a global leader in the consumer industries, and we
believe that Centric PLM has the potential to become a $1 billion plus business in the coming years.
Now having said that, it's time for me to hand over to Rouven. Rouven, you have the floor.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Thank you, Pascal, and thank you, Bernard. As you can see, Q2 was a strong quarter. We delivered on all our key objectives,
encompassing revenue growth, margin and EPS, driven by broad-based strength across pretty much all geographies and a healthy
contribution from picking up large deal activity. As a result, we wrapped up a good first half of the year, which puts us on trajectory to
achieve our full year objectives.
And before I go to the details of the presentation, the numbers I want to also quickly recall, and I'm sure you do that when we
introduced our objectives for Q2 back in April, we highlighted 3 main drivers to accelerate growth in the quarter: the first one was anDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2023 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 25, 2023
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8acceleration in North America; the second was a continued momentum in Europe across key industries; and the third was the return to
mid-single-digit growth in China. And in this quarter, all these elements were delivered as expected or with even better results. Now
let's take a look at our Q2 results in more detail.
Total revenue and software revenue grew consistently 8%, while service revenue was up 7% at constant currency in line with our
objectives. Upfront license revenue was up 6% year-over-year, ahead of our Q2 objectives, driven by the rebound in China and very
good performance in mainstream innovation with SOLIDWORKS as well as a healthy contribution from large deal activity across
Europe as well as North America.
Related to the performance in China, we highlighted during our Q1 call that we saw evidence of increasing activity in March. And in
fact, this trend continued, driving 8% growth in China in Q2. We're confident that this progressive trend is further raising the potential
for growth in the rest of the year.
Recurring revenue rose 9%, with subscription revenue up 13% year-over-year. Together, subscription upfront license revenue growth
was up 10%, highlighting the improving momentum for Q2. For the first 6 months, the share of recurring revenue reached 81% of
total software revenue. This represents a strong increase of 200 basis points versus last year.
While subscription revenue growth for SOLIDWORKS, Centric, CATIA and ENOVIA together was up over 30% and significantly
above the average growth rate in the quarter, we experienced a temporary slower growth at MEDIDATA, as highlighted by
Pascal earlier. So to complement what Pascal mentioned, I'd like to give you 3 points to explain what is driving the MEDIDATA
performance in Q2, and what to expect for the rest of the year. First, we are facing the impact of lower clinical trial starts observed by
global industry data. Second, the impact of COVID mega studies, which phased out during Q2 and Q3 of last year, which creates the
baseline impact. And the third point is the momentum with top 50 pharma customers. So let's go through this one by one.
First, we are seeing a more deliberate investment environment in which CROs continuing to adjust volumes. Worldwide, in 2Q 2023,
according to global industry data, clinical trial start decreased by around 10% year-over-year. Now while the study start volume
was under pressure, our win rates remained strong on average at around 75%. Second, when we compare to Q2 last year, we had the
benefit of the ending mega trial, which was started during the pandemic. Typically, at the end of such complex studies, we are entitled
to true up revenue. This creates an unfavorable baseline effect with an impact of approximately 3 points to the growth rate. We expect
a similar effect in Q3 before we are back to double-digit growth.
Third, we signed several multiyear renewals with top 50 pharma. This is evidenced by strong total quarter bookings up 17%. On top,
we continued to see strong renewal rates, more than 20% above par level over the trailing 12-month period, as well as our revenue
retention rate remains above 99.5%.
So to summarize, the lower subscription revenue growth contribution of MEDIDATA is temporary, and we are confident that growth
will rebound towards the end of the year and further into 2024.
Looking at our strategic growth drivers of 3DEXPERIENCE and cloud. 3DEXPERIENCE revenue in the first 6 months grew 5%
at constant currencies. This reflects a share of 31% of 3DEXPERIENCE addressable software revenue, which is flat year-over-
year relative to a very strong comparison base last year. And as we highlighted before, our 3DEXPERIENCE deal road map is
strengthening in the second half so we expect to see a share of increase in 2H.
Cloud revenue in the first 6 months rose 14%, now representing 24% of software revenue, which is an increase of 2 points. While
MEDIDATA growth contribution was lower this quarter for the reasons mentioned, growth in 3DEXPERIENCE cloud remains at a
healthy clip. We are well positioned to continue to capitalize on our leading position in key industries, capturing above-market growth
in 3DEXPERIENCE and cloud.
Now let's review how we performed relative to the objectives we set for the second quarter. We reported total revenue of EUR 1.449
billion, and unlike in previous quarters, we had a currency headwind of 50 basis points, resulting in a negative FX impact of EUR 7
million. During this period, adjusted for currency, total revenue was EUR 5 million, higher than the midpoint of our target range due
to the overperformance in software revenue by EUR 4 million and services by EUR 1 million.
We reported an operating margin of 31%, 50 basis points above the high end of the range and 80 basis points higher than the midpoint.
This better revenue -- the better revenue performance and lower OpEx growth together contributed 110 basis points improvement
versus the midpoint, which was partially offset by a negative currency impact of 30 basis points.
Now as you can see, it's clear from these numbers that we delivered on our profitability targets while continuing to invest. We added
over 300 net new employees during the quarter and 650 for the first 6 months. Due to our disciplined investment approach, we areDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2023 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 25, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9well on track to manage our OpEx growth in 2023, offsetting the carryover effect resulting from strong hiring last year. And this gives
us the visibility to continue our focused investment in the second half of the year to address our long-term opportunities.
Now turning to the earnings per share. Very briefly, we reported EUR 0.28 as reported. And at the high end of -- we are at the high
end of our range of EUR 0.27 to EUR 0.28, and we also offset a slightly negative currency impact of EUR 0.004 given the better
performance.
Now turning on to the cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash and cash equivalents totaled EUR 3.345 billion compared to EUR
2.769 billion at the end of 2022. This reflects an increase of EUR 576 million. At the end of the quarter, our net financial position
totaled EUR 352 million, an increase of EUR 579 million versus the net financial debt of EUR 227 million at the end of last year.
Now let's look at what is driving our cash position at the end of the second quarter. We generated EUR 1.026 billion in operating cash
flow year-to-date. This was slightly lower by 2% or EUR 22 million when compared to the first 6 months of last year. There're 2 main
insights here to share with you on what's driving this performance. First one, we continued to see good momentum in our working
capital. The net change in operating working capital is up by 5%, driven mainly by strong collections, evidenced by sequentially
improving DSOs. This is partially offset by a slightly unfavorable change in the nonoperating working capital due to higher tax rate.
Second, the net income adjusted for noncash items is lower versus last year because of 2 facts. First, as discussed, we decided to invest
at higher levels in 2022 to accelerate top line growth. And as a result, we are absorbing the expense carryover effect now in 2023. At
the same time, the progressive revenue growth acceleration is taking off. And the second fact is that the remaining gap is a result of an
increase in social charges for share-based compensation due to the higher share price versus last year. And for more details, I refer you
to the reconciliation table in our appendix.
Now to sum up, operating cash flow was mainly used for CapEx of EUR 67 million, payment of lease liabilities of EUR 42 million
and the cash dividend paid in Q2 of EUR 276 million. And lastly, of note, we had a negative FX impact of EUR 56 million year-to-
date 2023.
Now let's turn to our fiscal year 2023 objectives. We are maintaining our guidance. The key takeaway is, as you heard from Bernard
already, we are on a good trajectory to achieve our long-term financial objectives of EUR 1.20 earnings per share. Total revenue
growth between 8% to 9% at constant currency remains unchanged. In absolute terms, we are offsetting the FX impact of minus EUR
7 million to the year by raising the performance to maintain the range as is of EUR 5.940 billion to EUR 5.990 billion. This assumes
that we expect progressive growth acceleration throughout the remainder of the year, driven by an increasing contribution from large
deal activity in the second half and mid- to high-single-digit growth in China, continuing the good Q2 trend. Finally, we reaffirm the
operating margin range of 32.3% to 32.6%.
Before moving to the Q3 objectives, I would like to emphasize that this unchanged full year revenue guidance assumes that we
maintain growth rates at constant currency for software revenue of 8% to 9%, service revenue of 5% to 7%. We continue to expect
recurring revenue growth in the range of 10% to 11% with strong subscription revenue increasing in the range of 17% to 18%.
Following the good trend of Q2 and upfront license revenue, we remain confident for the full year in the range of 2% to 5%.
Now let's turn to the Q3 objectives. We are targeting total revenue growth of 8% to 10% at constant currency, with recurring revenue
increasing by 10%, driven by strong subscription growth of 17% to 19%. We are forecasting upfront license revenue growth of 6% to
10%. This reflects an acceleration in subscription revenue growth in Q3 versus Q2, and this is driven by an increasing share of large
3DEXPERIENCE subscription deals, continued momentum in adopting subscription-based pricing of the SOLIDWORKS customer
base, and continued strong growth from Centric PLM. As mentioned, and for the reasons outlined before, MEDIDATA is expected
to contribute mid- to high single digits in Q3 before returning to double-digit growth in Q4. For services revenue, we are predicting a
normalized 2% to 5% growth.
In terms of profitability, we are forecasting operating margin of 30.2% to 30.5%, and diluted EPS of EUR 0.26 to EUR 0.27. For
additional information and to review what we've discussed, please take a look at our earnings presentation.
In conclusion, we've had a good first half of the year with strong second quarter results. The growth is broad-based and the momentum
is improving across all major geographies, driven by strength in industrial and mainstream innovation. We are on track to achieve our
objectives for the year, which reflects an acceleration of growth in 2H. These results demonstrate that our platform strategy is well
aligned with the priorities of our clients. We are focused on execution to deliver our sustainable growth throughout the year. And as
such, we remain confident to achieve and advance towards our EPS objective of EUR 1.20 for the year.
And now with this, Bernard, Pascal and I are happy to take your questions.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2023 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 25, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And the question comes from the line Michael Briest from UBS.
Michael Briest
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Just on the MEDIDATA performance. Can you talk about the mix of the business that you have between pharma and biotech and
the CROs because clearly, the CRO change was quite dramatic. And then on Centric PLM, just looking at my notes, I think in 2020,
the business had EUR 76 million in revenues. So when you're talking about EUR 1 billion, can we assume this is an area that you're
actively looking for acquisitions in?
Bernard S. Charles
Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Michael, for the question. On MEDIDATA, the mix between biotech and pharma to CROs is about 60-40. And it has --
the CROs have picked up in terms of their growth over the years. It used to be 30-70, it's now more 40-60. And that's due to the very
strong volume increase that we have experienced since 2019. And I think we are now in a period where this is going more back to the
30-70 we had before potentially.
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Michael, related to Centric PLM. You're right. I mean this year, we do expect to be close to EUR 200 million, which, to a certain
extent -- yes, software. I'm saying, Rouven, telling me, it's higher than this. But anyway, my point is the next step is really EUR 0.5
billion and then after it's EUR 1 billion. To go to the EUR 0.5 billion, I think with what we have done until now, everything is set. As
I was explaining, the diversification from a subsegment industry standpoint, moving from apparel and fashion to retail to consumer
electronics to personal care, right?
The fact also that we are expanding from the brands to the retailers and to the manufacturers as well is really opening coverage
expansions in order to nurture the growth. At the same time, we are evolving the concept of the collection management to the business
platform. Because, at the end, Centric, PLM is a business platform for all the customers in the consumer industries.
And more and more, they are using this business platform as a way to enable, if you want, the online sales. And you noticed, we
did some very small acquisitions to enhance the portfolio. One was related to the pricing, how we can integrate the pricing as part
of the strategy in order, not only when you do the collections and you operate if you want the portfolio for the online sales to be
able to modelize the performance of the business plan, but also to be able to do some real-time price adjustment, which is extremely
important in the fast-moving goods because as you know, you have a lot of elasticity on price.
We are also expanding on the planning side, right? Because it's a complex chain. It's a complex value network. Having the ability to
optimize the planning for all the different stakeholders is becoming something extremely important. Why we do this? Because you
remember Centric is a subscription-based model for the vast majority of what we do. And each time we are renewing, we have exactly
the same strategy that we have with MEDIDATA is not to renew at parity, of course, is to expand the share of wallets. And that's how
we are complementing, if you want, by having additional modules to give reasons for the customer to expand with us and to consider
Centric PLM a little bit more than the collection management systems.
That's, I think, the foundations to go to the EUR 0.5 billion. And I think it's probably too early to speak about how we will do the other
half, and I will come back at the appropriate time on this.
Operator
The questions come from the line of Laurent Daure from Kepler Cheuvreux.
Laurent Daure
Kepler Cheuvreux, Research Division
I also have 2 questions. The first is back to MEDIDATA. I understand your comments for the coming quarters, but I was also
interested in your views when, today, you discussed with your main clients their plans in terms of number of trials they have maybeDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2023 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 25, 2023
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 112 or 3 years from now, don't you think that there is a risk of really softness, not just for a few quarters, but in the longer term? So any
granularity on this will be more than welcome.
And my second question is more for Rouven. On the margin side, when I look at your Q3, you need a much stronger margin in the
fourth quarter. So we understand the wages are moderating and the headcount growth is also moderating. But do you also have other
drivers to give us more comfort into your full year objectives?
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
I take the first one, Rouven. You can complement whatever you want. So Laurent, again, if you look at the trend for the clinical trial,
the average growth is between 6% to 8% for decades, right? And this is a normalized growth. When COVID happened, we had an
extra. These numbers almost improved by 50%, right, exceeding 10%, 12% was the number. So I think on the long run, we are not
making a mistake to assume that the underlying growth will stay what we have seen in the last decade. And we have evidence of this.
And you could cross check with many, many studies. That's one piece.
The second piece, as Rouven was saying, our winning rate is extremely high for at least the Phase II and the Phase III where, as you
know, this is the bulk of the market, is exceeding 75%, and we continue to improve the winning rates.
Last but not least, it's something also extremely important. I was making this comment when I was commenting why certain
customers are selecting us. It's because we are bringing not only the solutions, the technical solutions, but also the therapeutic domain
expertise. We could claim we have a significant presence in the oncology, but if I subsegment all the clinical trials in different
domains, there are still areas where we could expand significantly, right? One of them is probably related to, for example, the
Alzheimer. As you may know, you have a lot of new molecules coming on the market. It's a promising market in the coming years.
And those clinical trials are extremely complex because not only you have to measure from a biology standpoint, from a medical
standpoint what it means, but also you have to assess the behavior of the people. And this mix is a complex thing to do, against just as
administration, how we could continue to expand.
So if you do the sum, the combination between the market growth plus the winning market share and the expansion to subsegment the
market, I think we have enough to continue to maintain the rhythms and to continue to expand what you have experienced in the last
years since MEDIDATA came to -- with us.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Okay. Laurent, I take the second question because I have nothing to add to the first. On the margin, we had very good margin
performance in the second quarter, thanks to the measures we have taken and the disciplined approach to our investments. We have
very good visibility into the second half of the year as it relates to OpEx. I remember, in Q1, the OpEx growth of around 13% year-
over-year. Q2 was 8%. And it's right in Q4, in our plan, we've set the majority of -- we've essentially consumed the expense carryover
by the end of Q3 to see the full benefit in Q4.
And I would say we are, in fact, a little bit ahead of the plan. So we have good visibility. Given the strong performance in Q2, we were
able to risk adjust for the second half. I might not have -- we might not have reflected everything of this in the Q3 guidance, right, to
give us just some room, but we have good visibility for the year on the margin. I hope that gives you the comfort that you're looking
for.
Operator
The questions come from the line of James Goodman from Barclays.
James Arthur Goodman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Apologies to add 1 more just around the MEDIDATA situation, just maybe zooming out a little bit. Just wondered if you could --
you've talked a bit about the win rates. But just from a competitive situation, clearly, there's been quite a lot of noise in the market
over the course of this year. One of your competitors is growing quite fast in R&D. And I wondered if you could talk about it from
a product perspective. So a lot of top 50 deals, but is that primarily EDC or how successful is the business being cross-selling other
main modules like CTMS into that base?DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2023 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 25, 2023
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12And has the competitive situation had any impact at all, and there's been some management change in that business over the course of
this year as well.
Second question, just around the SOLIDWORKS strength. I think you've got some price rises due to come through in July. Just
wondered if there's any one-off impact that you can defer in this quarter from any sort of form of customer behavior ahead of that or
sort of early price rises that might have come in already.
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Okay. I will start with the first part, Rouven, and maybe you can take the SOLIDWORKS question.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Sure.
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
So related to the competitive landscape. I think there are 2 ways to address your topic. The first one is, the environment, to a certain
extent, is forcing certain customers also to consolidate their choice. At the COVID time, we saw a lot of startups coming promising
sometime the moon and having hard time to deliver. It was extremely obvious, for example, in what we call the decentralized clinical
trial, right, when you have to do the trial from home. Why I am saying this? Because we are rescuing right now some of those large
studies using start-up solutions. And some of them are in bankrupt or close to.
Where I want to go with this? I think the platform concept is becoming more and more understandable by this industry. Because for
a long time, they were putting, I think, more emphasis on the best-of-breed approach. Now they start to see the benefits of having
the platform to connect the dots. And to a certain extent, if I want to make an analogy, what's happened in our manufacturing space,
I don't know, 10 years ago, 15 years ago or maybe 20, when the market moved from the traditional PDM approach to the platform-
based approach is happening also in this industry, moving from what we call the EDC approach, electronic data records, to a platform-
based approach, which is much more data-centered, AI-based, modeling and simulation enabled.
And this is making the big difference because all the modules, whatever we call -- we speak about ECO, RTMS, CTMS, all this
collection of very specialized modules will be redefined in a completely different manner because many of the functionality will
be managed at the platform level and not anymore at the application level. This is happening. This is changing a lot of the way the
landscape is structured and defined. And I think we are leading this transformation by far. Proof of what I'm saying. Obviously, the
platform concept is extremely meaningful for the top 50 large companies because you know this industry is heavily concentrated.
And the bookings for this segment is almost growing 2x faster than the current performance of MEDIDATA, right? So the traction is
there. And as you may know, this is where one of our competitors, probably the one you have in mind, they are focusing right now.
So to a certain extent, if you look at the different elements, what is happening from reconfigurations of the system standpoint plus the
market trend we are really experiencing right now, I think we are in a very good position.
The exposure we have on the small biotech does exist but mainly through the CROs, right? This is what we call the study-by-study
business. And as you may know, what does it mean? It means they are not contractualizing with us on the global enterprise in order
to have a capacity to run different studies. We are contracting one by one. The way to do it is usually through the CROs. And that's
the reason why what Rouven was saying. This is where we are seeing the volume decreasing, but at the same time, our market share
is increasing. Because from an efficiency standpoint, when the volumes are dropping, if you are big CROs, you need to improve
your efficacy and your efficiency. And we have a lot of technology to make this happen. It's extremely visible with against the large
contract we have with the largest CRO whatever it's PPD of IQVIA, just -- or Syneos, just to name a few of them. That's for the
competitive landscape. Maybe, Rouven, you can take the question related to SOLIDWORKS.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes, happy to. James, on SOLIDWORKS. I think for you, the main key takeaway is that on a year-to-date basis, we are back to 7%
growth. Q2, as we said, is 12%. On the license, Q2 was very strong with 15% while we were actually down 14% in Q1. So Q2 and
Q1, you see the trend reversing. And if we look at the contribution from China, Pascal mentioned that, it's really a catch-up from the
low level of consumption in Q4 and 2022, where the investment cycles are now geared towards innovation to retool and expand --DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2023 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 25, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 13accelerate innovation cycles and scale. We see that clearly in China. The price increase in China was very, very marginal so there is no
such thing than anticipation. In North America, the sequential growth in SOLIDWORKS is flat. So we have a similar performance. So
do not expect there to be any anticipation. I think we are already on a kind of normalized trend. And so we expect now the 7% to 8%
as the run rate go forward as we have seen in previous years.
Operator
The questions come from land of Nicolas David from ODDO BHF.
Nicolas David
ODDO BHF Corporate & Markets, Research Division
I have 2. The first one is regarding China. How should we see H2 after the very strong Q2? I mean, do you think that Q2 benefited
from a catch-up after several quarters very low? Or is it a normal performance, and we can expect in the new world and expect growth
to continue like that in H2? And you didn't mention China specific case of Industrial Innovation, larger contracts, where do you stand
there?
And my second question is regarding 3DEXPERIENCE. Could you help us reconcile the difference of growth you have from
3DEXPERIENCE and Industrial Innovation, which is still pretty strong, while 3DEXPERIENCE are growing less? And does it have
an impact all in all on your revenue growth because of a shortfall of revenue given that 3DEXPERIENCE tend to be higher in terms of
pricing and cross-selling. Any color would be helpful.
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
So I will start first. I'll just say, China, there are 2 trends. One was the catch-up on the mainstream market. That's what we were
expecting to happen. And you have seen the result in Q2. And if I look at the pipeline for H2, it's normalized, right. The second one is
the SOE, the state-owned company, where you remember, in the first half of the year, first, many of them, they were waiting for the
elections to happen before to engage, commercially speaking. And, two, the geopolitics has, to a certain extent, slowed down a little
bit the process because for many of them, right now, when they are buying a piece of software, they should almost justify why they
are not buying Chinese software or what they want to do?
Why I'm saying this because in Q2, you have the benefit of the rebound of the Mainstream, but you do not have yet the full
contribution of the large SOE transaction we have in our pipeline. They are expected to be closed in H2. Whatever it's in the aerospace
or transportation and mobility and industrial equipment, this is where we have the largest one, and also in construction.
So to answer to your question, so we are relatively confident that you will see something similar happen for Q3. And I still expect
to have certain accelerations happening probably between Q3 and Q4. But right now, I'm betting much more on Q4 than Q3. That's
where we are.
Related to the 3DEXPERIENCE platform, it's almost the same story. Again, you have seen certain -- the last transaction was missing
in Q1. They are coming back in Q2. And you will see the benefit of them in Q3 and Q4, and all of them are 3DEXPERIENCE
related. So the contribution in the mix will improve, and you will see that at the end of the year, we will be aligned with what we were
expecting for this year. We are relatively dependent on those large transactions, which is normal. And as you may know, usually, they
are backloaded, and that's the reason why from a quarter to another one, we are giving this indicator, but the reality at the end, the
most important is to be aligned on the trajectory on a yearly basis because it's a multiyear plan, right? If you want to add a few things,
Rouven, feel free. If not...

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 14just regarding SOLIDWORKS in China, when you mentioned H2 should be normalized. It's normalize at the same level in Q2 or
normalize at a more lower level.
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
No, no. It will be the one it used to be. I mean, I do not expect to do a 20-plus percent growth in mainstream in China every quarter,
overall, total software for mainstream. On a license standpoint, yes, right, which, again, is a double-digit growth. That's what we are
targeting. And it's a good sign you remember because the mainstream market is usually the only indicator for the investment cycle,
and Rouven and I, we were relatively careful. If you remember at the beginning of the year when we came with the guidance, some of
you were pushing us to be more aggressive on China. And we say, no, no, this is what -- not what we are seeing in the pipeline. But to
a certain extent now, I think it's almost the opposite. You have a lot of comments related to potentially a slowdown in China and, to a
certain extent, we have a better visibility for the second half of the year than we have for the first half of the year.
Because, remember, the first priority for the Chinese economy was to relaunch the consumption. Now they are investing to relaunch
the innovation cycle, and it's extremely visible on our side in all the different sectors we are touching.

The questions come from the line of Toby Ogg from JPMorgan.
Toby Ogg
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
A couple from me. Just firstly, on the guidance for Q3, just the subscription growth 17% to 19%. In the quarter, you've indicated
MEDIDATA to be probably sort of mid-single to high single digit in Q3. So recovery on the subscription won't be from the
MEDIDATA side. So just mechanically, where does that reacceleration come from on the subscription part of the business? And is
there any upfront revenue recognition from SOLIDWORKS in there?
Then secondly, just on the MEDIDATA outlook into the second half. You mentioned the return to double digit by the end of the year
and Q3 could be that mid- to high-single-digit. So I guess the question here is what would drive the mid- to high in Q3 versus the
high-single-digit done in Q2? And then what have you assumed for the development of clinical trial starts through the second half of
the year?
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Okay. Toby, I go -- I will take a run at your questions and, Pascal, please add. So the first one on the guidance. Yes, 17% to
19%, 13% in Q2 and 13% year-to-date. So the key drivers of the acceleration is, as Pascal mentioned before, we have significant
3DEXPERIENCE opportunities in our deal road map in Q3 in key industries, and they are well advanced at their expansion with the
existing clients. They are going on an accelerated path to adopt 3DEXPERIENCE platform.
The second part, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which is really an important message for you to take from this call is that the
SOLIDWORKS customer base is increasingly adopting the subscription-based pricing. The subscription growth for SOLIDWORKS
has been up 50% year-to-date, and the number becomes meaningful. And then we mentioned and talked about the strong growth of
Centric. Centric is a subscription business. We transitioned that entirely to be subscription. And that's growing extremely nice, as
Pascal mentioned, we had this large deal in Q2, and we have a good pipeline in 2H.
So yes, MEDIDATA will be back to double-digit growth in Q4. And -- because of 2 reasons. #1 is, we will be, through the baseline
effect that I've explained in Q2, which will recur in Q3 as a result of the ramp-up of the large mega trials of 2020 that wrapped up in
2022, where we had the benefit of recurring up revenue at the end of this, which is kind of a onetime revenue when that be recognized
in 2022 that creates an unfavorable comparison of about 3 points to the growth rate in 2023.
We will have that behind us in Q4, and we will also compare, I think, to have a more favorable comparison in Q4 versus in Q2 and Q3
overall also because of volume. We have seen that the lower volume growth already starting at the end of last year. While now as we
had some renewals with bigger CROs that were lower for the reasons Pascal explained, where we see this trend now becoming a little
bit more material. So we are starting to normalize that. And of course, a good performance in the enterprise, top pharma 50 companies
bookings, they will translate into revenue in the following quarters. So that's the summary of the subscription performance and the
explanation for MEDIDATA.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2023 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 25, 2023

The questions come from the line of Frederic E. Boulan from Bank of America.
Frederic Emile Alfred Boulan
BofA Securities, Research Division
First of all, on Industrial Innovation, we had a nice acceleration this quarter on the '22 that was pretty strong. So we discussed some of
the impacts on China, but is there anything more specific or additional you want to point out in terms of a driver of that? And to what
degree you think this is sustainable.
Second question around free cash flow. So you -- we had a second quarter that was impacted by about EUR 150 million negative
working cap. You flagged this impact on cash taxes. But can you discuss more broadly working cap, how you see that developing
through the rest of the year, and how we think about this for cash flow for this year?
And then if I can, just a quick clarification on your commentary around growth. I think in Mainstream Innovation, you mentioned
you expect 7% to 8% as gross run rate go forward. Is this a commentary for SOLIDWORKS in particular or for the whole segment? I
think you did 12% in Q3. So I just wanted to clarify that.
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Okay. I'll take the first one. So again, the best way to answer to your question is to look at by industry subsegment. I think the trend
is still extremely positive in aerospace across the board, Europe, U.S., Asia, not only for the large OEM, but also for the supply chain
at large. And as you may know, almost the industry standardized on 3DEXPERIENCE platform. And this is triggering, to a certain
extent, the expansion towards the simulations, the manufacturing and cyber system design, which are really the expansion we are
bringing with the new set of solutions. So that's one thing. The transportation and mobility sector is also steady for us, mean same
thing is happening across the board, driven by the electrification of the car, but also the new mobility experience. And we see more
and more innovations coming.
You have this market trend, which is what we call the software-defined vehicles. And probably it's a topic on which we will come
back to give you our perspectives and how we position ourselves on this, but it's a major trend touching this industry at large, and we
are benefiting from this. The next segment is Industrial Equipment because industrial equipment, we -- the vast majority is coming
from the mainstream, but we have a significant footprint with CATIA and [indiscernible] platform and ENOVIA specifically and also
SIMULIA for the very complex equipment. And this market is also a good one where, I think, we have a good winning rate, and we
are expanding our footprint.
So overall, if you look at -- and it's my echoing commentary as an introduction. We see -- we saw a rebound in the investments
in the innovation cycle. It's happening in the industry. And again, when we are telling you the manufacturing industry, there is a
convergence of the experience economy on one hand and the circularity on the other hand, it's really, really redefining the entire
portfolio for all those companies. And the disruptions coming from the supply chain and the materials are still there.
But now there is also an opportunity if you want to rebuild in a different way. You cannot imagine, for example, in Aerospace &
Defense how many time we spent to discuss about the new materials to choose certain existing materials, but each time you introduce
a new material, this is changing everything. This is changing the design. This is changing the way you produce, the way you maintain.
And this is impacting at large the cycle. So that's, to a certain extent, the reason why the -- you have seen this good trend in the
manufacturing innovation board, driven specifically by the manufacturing industry, but not only. And it's touching almost all the
different product lines we have, starting with CATIA, which is the largest one.
Beatrix, do we conclude here.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
So we have -- I think the cash flow question...
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Oh, cash flow.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2023 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 25, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
So on the cash flow, you wanted some assurance and explanation for Q2. I would encourage you to look at year-to-date because we
always have some seasonality in the number. And when you look at the working capital, on a year-to-date basis, the operating working
capital, in fact, is improving by EUR 49 million year-over-year. We've explained this in detail in the documents that we've provided
you today. I want to highlight 1 or 2 things that are standing out in this. One, which is when you look at the decrease in trade accounts
receivables and contract assets, this decrease was very strong in Q1 because of strong collections in Q1 and the extreme high level of
activity in Q4.
Remember, Q1 this year was a softer quarter. As such, you would expect the collections from Q1 also be slightly lower than what our
growth rate -- our growth trajectory certainly is. So there is a seasonality impact here between Q1 and Q2, where the decrease in trade
receivables in Q2 is lower than what we had in Q2 of last year. So -- but the balance of Q1 and Q2 is still favorable, very much so, of
EUR 151 million. And now you combine this with the contract liability -- the increase in contract liability, which is down year-over-
year. Last year, we had a really strong impact in the increase of contract liabilities at the time when we increased -- when we did the
pricing change for SOLIDWORKS. And there, lots of SOLIDWORKS customers bought multiyear subscription and multiyear deals.
And that elevated very much the contract liability as a deferred revenue. We didn't have that buying in advance in Q2 this time
because it was more of a catch-up and less so multiyear. So that explains the difference in the -- the big difference in the contract
liabilities. But the net of it is positive, keep that in mind. I think the unfavorability in the nonoperating is very marginal, minus EUR
13 million. This is a little bit of noise. This will balance out.
It's really due to the higher tax payments because of our growth, right? We simply see activity that's reflected in that. For the
rest of the year, DSOs are improving. I think we have improved DSOs even though there's -- you could argue the difficult macro
environment, but we're doing a good job in driving collections, and I see this trend to continue. And so for the full year, we are
expecting our operating cash flow to grow in line with our operating performance.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 4Presentation
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
Good morning, everyone. This is Beatrix Martinez speaking, Dassault Systèmes VP, Investor Relations. From the company, we
have today, Bernard Charlès, joining us remotely. So our Chairman and CEO; Pascal Daloz, Deputy CEO and COO; and Rouven
Bergmann, CFO. I would like to welcome you to Dassault Systèmes Third Quarter 2023 webcast presentation. At the end of the
presentation, we will take questions from participants. Later today, we will also hold a conference call.
Dassault Systèmes results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. Most of the financial figures in this conference call are presented on
a non-IFRS basis, with revenue growth rates in constant currencies, unless otherwise noted. For an understanding of the differences
between the IFRS and the non-IFRS, please see the reconciliation tables included in our press release.
Some of the comments we will make during today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements, which could differ
materially from actual results. Please refer to our risk factors in our 2022 universal registration document.
I will now hand over to Bernard Charlès.
Bernard S. Charles
Chairman & CEO
Thank you very much, Beatrix. Good morning, everyone. I am delighted to connect with you this morning. The very solid and
differentiating foundation of Dassault Systèmes are very well illustrated [Audio Gap]. As you do know, the virtual twin is science-
based. It's being adopted by all industries we serve. It's a way to capitalize knowledge and know-how, and it can be experienced, can
be simulated. It's better to not see things only but verify that it works.
So as a result of that, the software revenue is up 12%, above the objective of the quarter. Subscription is very strong, which
demonstrate and Rouven will sure will tell more about that, that our successful transition is happening for subscription, up 18%,
accelerating sequentially despite the fact that we continue to invest, and we did invest last year and we continue to invest this year,
with headcount up 5%, unlike many competitors reducing their capacity. We continue to increase. The operating margin is at 31%, up
50 basis points year after year. And EPS is up 20%. So it enabled us to confirm our full year objectives. Rouven and Pascal will tell
more about that.
But not only that, I think remember, our 5 years plan, which was announced, remember well at the end of 2018, is well on track, I
think. We'll come back on this in February. So beyond that, our opportunities are, I think, very strong. They are very strong for the
new lead team, led by Pascal Daloz on the team. Really, I think we have created next-generation platform.
We have the opportunity to serve all types of industries, manufacturing, life science and health care as well as infrastructure with
what we call the move to software-defined solutions, where there is really a conjunction between the experience economy and
the sustainable economy. And we are investing massively, and we continue to expand what we started 15 years ago. The use of
AI is already there in CATIA, V5 was there and continue to expand in all our brands now to complement modeling, simulation,
data science. It's good to know the laws of science. When you don't know them, then you do AI on the data science. So I think this
connectivity is making us unique from that standpoint.
So with that, I leave the floor to Pascal and Rouven to tell you more.
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Thank you, Bernard. So good morning, and it's always a pleasure to be with you at this physically in London with some of you and for
the others over the phone.
So let's come back to a few statements about the vision. We had the Capital Market Day a few months ago, and I just want to remind
a few things. The first one is, you remember, we have craft the next horizons, the 2040 horizons. And the 2 fundamental trends behind
are the following: the fact that we are shifting from product to experiences, and this is happening in all the industry we serve. And
the second thing is the economy is also transitioning from what we call a linear approach to a circular approach in order to take care
about the sustainability challenges. And those 2 bets are really the one where, to a certain extent, we are building the next horizon forDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2023 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 25, 2023
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 5Dassault Systèmes, and we call it metamorphosis because it's more than a transition or a radical change. It's a reinvention. So that's for
you to give the context.
The second thing is why -- we were the one inventing the PLM early 2000s and why it's time to redefine what PLM is about. For the
last 40 years, the PLM was focusing on the left side of this loop, which is how to use a virtual twin to do the imagination, the creation
and the production and the delivery virtually. Now it's time also to connect the twin with what is happening in the real world. And this
is the best way to deliver the experiences. So the twin is not only a way to create and to imagine, but it's also more and more a way to
manage the life of the things in usage.
The second topic is PLM means product life cycle management. And with this circularity, the product could have multiple life. So the
topic right now is not only to manage one life. It's to manage multiple life of the products. And the twin is really the way to couple the
2 together. An illustration of this, and Bernard just mentioned a few words about it, is what is happening in the auto sector. We have
what we call the software-defined vehicles. And it's really a new concept where you see more and more the value transitioning from
the physical assets, if you want, to the software piece in order to create this new mobility experience economy.
And the twin is, again, a way to do the personalization, the connections to provide additional services in order to reinvent what the
mobility is about. And why -- maybe a longer story, we could have a video.
[Presentation]
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Really the knowledge and the know-how of the company, and this is giving a foundation, which is extremely unique compared to
many others.
The second thing is we are mixing the modeling and the simulations with the generative AI approach. And this is giving the ability
to do those 3 things. It's a way to open new space of possibility. And here, you have an example of how the system is helping you to
guide to find new materials for battery, for example. You remember, it's also something we do in the therapeutics, where the AI is
generating automatically the molecules. It's empowering the people with a new level of synthesis. And this is extremely important. We
believe the generative AI is not a way to substitute people. It's a way to empower them, to elevate them if you want.
And last but not least, it's, I think, helping the people to navigate in the complexity of the decisions. And there is a big difference
by deciding the uncertainty and deciding in unknown. And when you are addressing the innovations market to a certain extent, you
need to take a lot of decision without having the full knowledge. And this is where the generative AIs could help you. And you
remember, it was an example I shared last time where the AI was helping the OEMs to figure out the impact of the fluctuation of the
raw materials, right? And it was extremely difficult to predict. However, having this ability all the time to manage and to build the
contingency plan, this is extremely valuable for the industry at large.
Speaking about the quarter, I think I will characterize this quarter by a number of significant large commercial agreements, right?
That's probably the most visible part of the Q3, and I will say a few words about this.
It happened specifically in the manufacturing industry. You have seen the press release. I mean the momentum is extremely good.
And why it's coming at the right time because it's a mix of constraint this industry is facing. They need to gain the competitive edge
advantage. They need to meet the regulatory sustainability deadline. But at the same time, they need to manage the profitability and
also to decouple, if you want, the economic growth from the resource consumption. So it's a real challenge, and that's the reason why
many of our customers are really more than rediscovering if you want, the value of the platform approach. So it's really happening in
the manufacturing industry, especially in the core industry we serve. So the Auto, Transportation & Mobility, Aerospace & Defense,
but also in the Consumer Packaged Goods, and I will give you some example of this.
In the Life Sciences and Healthcare, I think the investment cycle is probably less favorable for the time being, but, there is a big but,
we believe it's time for this industry to have new efficient and affordable drugs with a breakthrough. And this is an aspect which is
really the core of Dassault Systèmes, and I will come back, and I will give you details about this. And regarding the infrastructure and
cities, you remember the value of the twin is proven. What is missing is, to an extent, the scale from a go-to-market standpoint. And I
will illustrate how we are partnering with interesting company in this space.
So let's move to few comments. Let's start with Jaguar Land Rover. So you know they were the -- almost the first one adopting the
3DEXPERIENCE platform at the early days, and we renew and extend our contract for the next 5 years, aligning, obviously, the entire
program with their strategy. But the most important thing is the one which is written in bullet points.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2023 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 25, 2023
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 6First of all, we are expanding the reach in terms of number of users from a little bit more than 8,000 to a little bit less than 20,000
users. Why so? Because the platform is becoming the single environment for the entire value network. And you remember, it's a
topic we discussed many times is how the OEM can drag, if you want, the adoption of the entire supply chain of the -- by the -- of
3DEXPERIENCE platform adoption. And this is really happening.
The second thing, which is, I think, noticeable with this deal, is the first time we are combining, if you want, a hybrid model, giving
the ability for the customer to migrate progressively on the cloud. As you know, there is -- it's difficult for many of our customers
to shift overnight. So the question when we do those long-term agreements is how we are giving the flexibility for them to do it in a
smooth way without disrupting the business model, without having to reopen the negotiations. And this is what we did with JLR.
And last but not least, obviously, it's an important thing for them to reach their net zero carbon by 2039, and the program is
instrumental for that. So this is a major deal, and Rouven will probably give more details about it.
So we have a lot to say related to the Life Sciences. And as you may know, I think for -- since the acquisition of MEDIDATA, we
have directed a lot of investments on the new domain. The patient centricity is one of them. The AI is another one. Why so? Because
we believe this industry is really shifting from the way they approach clinical trials. And this, I have many examples this quarter.
I could have focused on the National Cancer Institute, which renew a contract, which is a significant contract for us. But I think
[indiscernible] difficult, it's probably more than another one, promoting the most decentralization of the clinical trials. And this
[ week ], on the growth portfolio, it's not only for one drug, it's really for the entire portfolio.
And why they are believing that decentralization is the way to move forward. There are 3 reasons. The first one is when you got a
trial, the frequency you are collecting the data is extremely important. If you collect the data each time you go to hospital, it's not
anymore enough. You need to collect data almost real time every day, every hour. And the only way [indiscernible] with centers and
collecting real-time data.
Two, actually, capturing some of that data which are important for important the clinical trials [indiscernible] having the context of the
data is also extremely important, especially if you want to understand what are the external factors influencing the clinical trial. And
that's also a way to do it when you decentralize the clinical trial.
And last but not least, the diversity is a big topic in the clinical trial. Why? Because you want to represent the entire population. And if
you are subject to the site and the site obviously localized, they are, I would say, limited by definitions. It's extremely difficult to have
the same representation of the diversity. So the 3 factors combined are really reshaping what the clinical trial is about.
Now let's move to infrastructure and cities. I'm very pleased to announce this new partnership we signed with WSP. Maybe you
don't know this company, but if you have 5 minutes, look at their website. It's a Canadian company. It's probably one of the largest
engineering and consulting firm in infrastructure. And they are #1 in many, many sectors like, obviously, the energy, the waste
infrastructure but also the transportation infrastructure. And why it's an interesting case because we are partnering with them to
do 2 things: one, to equip all the large projects they are handling and they are managing. And you remember, this market is highly
fragmented. Addressing the company one by one, it's a difficult thing to do. However, if you can -- if the platform could become the
collaborative environment for all the large projects, there is a way to connect almost all the stakeholders they want, and that's what we
are doing with WSP.
The second thing we do with them, it's an engineering firm. And more and more, they are expanding into the maintenance and
operations of the infrastructures. And they are betting on the fact that the twin will be -- the virtual twin will be the way to do it. So
this is the reason why I think it's a valuable example, illustrating relatively well what we are doing in this space.
Speaking about the performance for the Q3. A few comments related to the geo. Let's start with Europe. As you can see, 21% growth
for Europe, 14% since the beginning of the year. I mean it's really an outstanding performance. And you should notice that this growth
is really broad-based. It's not only one country. It's almost all the countries within Europe. It's driven by large deals. As I was saying,
JLR is one of them, but it's not the only one. So in Transportation & Mobility but also Home & Lifestyle. So this is also important to
notice that the diversification is also contributing to the momentum in Europe. And last but not least, the subscription adoption is also,
I mean, driving the momentum in Europe.
Americas, plus 9%, plus 8% since the beginning of the year. Again, we continue to have good momentum driven by subscriptions,
specifically in Transportation & Mobility, and for example, we signed the deal with General Motors this quarter. But also Aerospace
& Defense, Infrastructure, Energy & Materials. And I should add High Tech as well. We have a sizable transaction with Apple also.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2023 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 25, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7Asia, plus 5%, plus 2% since the beginning of the year, with continued improvements driven by India. India is still delivering a
double-digit growth. We have also an excellent performance in Japan especially in the industrial sector, a little bit softness in Korea.
And China is back to growth with plus 6%. And I -- to a certain extent, I have a good visibility for Q4 in China.
So if we move to the software by revenue lines, you will notice that the Industrial Innovation software is growing at 18%. So it's really
an outstanding performance, plus 10% compare since the beginning of the year. And you can see almost all the brands are growing
double digits, all the product lines. And it's driven by both the upfront license but also by subscriptions. So which is also a point that
the transitioning to subscription is happening in the core industry we serve and the core product lines.
Life Sciences software revenue, plus 3%, with MEDIDATA in line with what we say, which is the cloud subscription is mid-single
digits. And again, we will probably come back through the Q&A on this topic.
Mainstream Innovation software, plus 7%. SOLIDWORKS transition to subscription is really accelerating. Just keep in mind that the
subscription is representing 1/3 of the booking for SOLIDWORKS. It was 15% a year ago. So the transition is really happening. And
we have a strong momentum with CENTRIC PLM, and you will see it's coming from multiple fronts.
So if we zoom on CENTRIC PLM, and I really want to take a few times to say a few words about it. Not only we have established a
large footprint with almost 13,000 brands fully equipped, and they do the collection management with it, but we are expanding along
multiple axis. The first one is really the market expansion. We have subsegment the market. You remember, CENTRIC PLM was
really serving the fashion industry. And more and more, we're expanding into the outdoor and sports, cosmetics, food and beverage,
consumer goods. So this is really a market expansion.
The second thing is from a community expansion standpoint, they were focusing a lot on the brands, and now we see sizable deals
in the retail industry as well. So ALDI is one of them. It's a large transaction we signed in Q2. This quarter, we signed Decathlon.
But this is interesting because if you take ALDI, it's a 5 years contract. They are deploying the collection management across all the
different stores, and they are managing all the programs, all the marketing and the incentives for all the different programs at the same
time.
And we are also expanding the value propositions from the collection management to the business planning and more and more to e-
commerce. And we continue to invest, and I'm pleased to announce a small acquisition we did in order to fulfill this strategy, which is
in the domain of the pricing. And it's an AI-based company. What they do, they are basically using AI as a way to predict the pricing
and to guide the decision on the -- if you want, the sensibility of the price if you can basically accelerate your growth by playing with
the pricing. So a little bit less than EUR 4 million. The base price was EUR 15 million, and we have an earnout on top of this, 40
employees based in Germany, and they're part of CENTRIC for since months.
Why I'm saying this? Because if you combine those 3 axis, I think with Centric PLM, we are on the road to build EUR 1 billion
brand. If you remember, when we acquired this company, it was below EUR 100 million, EUR 90 million -- a little bit less than EUR
90 million. Now we will reach more than EUR 200 million this year. The next milestone is EUR 500 million, which is really -- the
momentum is already there. And with the 3 axis we are building, I think we are creating the foundations to build EUR 1 billion brand.
Conclusions for my section. I think we are extremely pleased with the Q3 performance, and Rouven will come back on this because
this is putting us in an ideal situation to conclude our 5 years plan, reaching EUR 1.20 EPS. And I think this is also giving a good
foundation for the next one, which is calling for doubling the EPS again in the next 5 years.
So Rouven, you have the floor.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Thank you, Pascal, and also good morning from my side. Welcome here in London and online. As Pascal mentioned, clearly, Q3
highlights the anticipated acceleration in the second half of 2023, with software revenue up 12% year-on-year, which is above the high
end of our objectives we set.
We can go to the next slide or I have to click. Good. That's good to know. This momentum is driven by continued acceleration of
subscription revenue growth, as Bernard already mentioned. It's up 18% year-over-year, and it's reflecting an increasing share of
large 3DEXPERIENCE wins but also a continued good momentum with SOLIDWORKS adopting the subscription model, as Pascal
mentioned, and strong performance of CENTRIC PLM, which is operating in the subscription model.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2023 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 25, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8The subscription growth drivers are broad-based and evidence across geos and the industries and give me the confidence that also
our annual subscription revenue growth will continue to accelerate moving forward despite the temporary lower contribution of
MEDIDATA, as explained during our last earnings call.
For the first 9 months, recurring revenue now accounts for 81% of total software revenue, which is up 80 basis points versus last year.
To complement the strong software revenue growth, we also saw a rebound in upfront license revenue, which is up 20% year-over-
year. And all of the above is reflecting the strength in new business growth and the anticipated acceleration versus the first 6 months.
Service revenue was up 2% at constant currency, in line with our objectives.
Now following the strong top line performance, we also advanced towards expanding our profitability. As evidenced by an operating
margin at 31%, which is up 50 basis points year-over-year and an EPS at EUR 0.28, which is up 20%, and it's all above the objective.
With these strong results in Q3, we confirm our full year objectives.
Before moving on to our long-term growth drivers, let me briefly share a few remarks highlighting the impact of large deals. The
framework we are applying is the following. We are expanding our relationships with existing clients as well as winning new ones,
which we refer to as value up and value wide. From a revenue growth perspective, you see a healthy contribution to in-quarter growth
and upfront license revenue, and more importantly, we are building the run rate and momentum in our subscription growth for quarters
to come.
To this end, we signed several multiyear subscription deals where the customers have the flexibility to adopt our cloud at day 1, laying
the foundation for long-term ratable revenue growth.
Now to the growth drivers. Consequently, the increasing share of predictable revenue provides us greater visibility and resiliency. Our
strategic growth drivers of 3DEXPERIENCE and cloud are at the center of the shift to our subscription strategy. 3DEXPERIENCE
revenue rose 46% in Q3 at constant currency. This reflects a share of 40% of 3DEXPERIENCE addressable software revenue, the
highest contribution ever.
In the first 9 months, 3DEXPERIENCE revenue grew 18% to 34% of software revenue. Cloud revenue grew 10% in Q3, representing
now 25% of software revenue, while MEDIDATA growth contribution was lower this quarter, as anticipated, due to the strong
comparison base. The growth in 3DEXPERIENCE cloud remains at a very healthy level. So we are well positioned to continue to
capitalize on our leading position in key industries, capturing above-market growth with 3DEXPERIENCE and cloud.
Now let's review how we performed relative to the objectives we set for the third quarter. To make it simple, we delivered strong
results, beating all our key objectives.
Total revenue was EUR 24 million above the mid and EUR 13 million above the high end, offsetting a negative currency impact of
about EUR 12 million. Operating margin was 70 basis points above the midpoint at 31%, net of negative currency impact of 40 basis
points, and we continue to invest to support our strategic initiatives with a net headcount growth of over 1,100 for the first 9 months,
which is up 5%.
Most importantly, this overperformance in Q3 highlights that the impact of the expense carryover, which muted the margin
performance in the first 6 months, is behind us, and we are now back to a more normal trend, with year-over-year margin
improvement of about 50 basis points. The strong operating performance in Q3 translates to EUR 0.28 in EPS, driving the upside was
at the high end of our objectives. In addition, the contribution of higher financial income was neutralized by a negative FX impact.
In summary, I've been talking with you about the revenue growth acceleration for some time now this year. As evidenced by the
Q3 results, we are delivering against what we said. While I will be addressing the full year outlook in a moment, it is important to
highlight that we are trending well within our objectives for the first 9 months. This further strengthens our confidence in our full year
financial plan for revenue and for profitability.
Now let's turn to cash flow and balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents totaled EUR 3.368 billion compared to EUR 2.769 billion at
the end of 2022, which is an increase of EUR 599 million. At the end of the quarter, our net cash position totaled EUR 378 million, an
increase of EUR 605 million versus a net financial debt of EUR 227 million at the end of last year.
Now let's look at what's driving our cash position at the end of the third quarter. We generated EUR 1.272 billion in operating cash
flow year-to-date in line with last year. Net income adjusted for noncash items and the balance of changes in working capital are
almost flat year-to-date versus last year. And we expect the operating cash flow to resume to growth in Q4.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2023 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 25, 2023
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9To sum up, operating cash flow was mainly used for the use of cash dividends paid in Q2 of over EUR 276 million, the net purchase
of treasury shares at a total of EUR 240 million and CapEx of EUR 103 million and repayment of lease liabilities of EUR 63 million.
Lastly, the total FX impact is not significant this year as compared to the first 3 quarters last year where it was more pronounced.
Now let's turn to our fiscal year 2023 objectives. There are 2 key messages to be shared with you. The first one is we are confirming
our guidance for revenue and operating margin while increasing the outlook for EPS to now EUR 1.20 at the midpoint of our range,
which used to be the high end of the guidance previously.
The second point to address is the notion of risk associated with a back-end loaded year, which some of you expressed. As mentioned
before, Q3 highlights the anticipated growth acceleration in the second half, and it now puts us in a position of strength to derisk
the fourth quarter outlook and remove these concerns. As such, we keep the midpoint of our total revenue objectives unchanged by
narrowing the range of total revenue to be now at EUR 5.945 billion to EUR 5.985 billion. So the range is now EUR 40 million.
For the full year margin, we apply the same logic: no change to the midpoint of 32.5%. And in fact, we are compensating the FX
headwind with a stronger operating performance. This reflects the positive trend of the margin uplift in the second half of the year
versus the first 6 months, as mentioned before.
To summarize our full year 2024 objectives, we maintained growth rates at constant currency for software revenue of 8% to 9% and
total revenue of 8% to 9%. This implies upfront license revenue in the range of 3% to 4% and recurring revenue to be in the range of
10% to 11%, with subscription growth unchanged in the range of 16% to 17%. Services revenue is expected in the range of 8% to 9%.
The operating margin range remains at 32.3% to 32.6%, with no change to the midpoint.
Before closing, let me provide a few additional data points that will help to shape your Q4 models. Given the strong operating
performance of Q3, we now project software revenue to grow at 8% to 10% in Q4. This implies recurring revenue growth in the range
of 11% to 13%, with subscription revenue increasing in the range of 18% to 23%. We slightly adjust the upfront license revenue to be
now in the range of minus 1% to plus 3% as we remain confident for the full year range of 3% to 4% growth. These objectives reflect
continued momentum in subscription revenue growth from new deals and increasing contribution from our run rate.
Now one additional comment regarding MEDIDATA. We expect growth to reaccelerate in Q4 to achieve double-digit growth for the
full year.
In terms of profitability, we expect the operating margin in the range of 35.8% to 36.6% and diluted EPS of EUR 0.35 to EUR 0.37.
This reflects the year-over-year improvement of 190 basis points and 10% to 14% growth ex FX, respectively.
Now of course, for additional information, please review today's earnings presentation in more detail.
So let me conclude. As evidenced by our strong Q3 results, we are on track to achieve our full year objectives for revenue and
profitability. Q3 performance is broad-based, driven by growth in 3DEXPERIENCE, closely aligned with our growth strategy as
discussed during our Capital Market Day. Our subscription revenue is driving the momentum of the company while we deliver the
productivity gains in the second half as planned. Finally, the confidence in the full year plan is supported by rebalancing our Q4
growth with a strong Q3 upside.
And now Bernard, Pascal and I will be happy to take your questions.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2023 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 25, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10Question and Answer
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
And from the room, we can start with Mo or Adam.
Mohammed Essaji Moawalla
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
A couple from me. Firstly, it was quite encouraging to see the -- some of your comments around some of these larger 3DX deals.
Rouven, you alluded to some recognition in the upfront license. But how should we think of the kind of the impact on the kind of
subscription line, given the kind of accelerating trajectory you've already started to see in the quarter? And if you could also comment
on the pipeline of the deals that you have and perhaps the visibility around closure amidst the current environment. And what has been
kind of the trigger now to cause this inflection and perhaps bring better line of sight?
Second one is just on MEDIDATA. It sounds like it's -- the comp is a bit or less difficult in Q4, but how should we think of that kind
of reacceleration in the MEDIDATA to shape? And as a result, when you put these 2 together, how should we think of that sort of run
rate on the subscription, with MEDIDATA being less of a drag, but then you've obviously got the momentum kind of on the core?
And then the last point was really on the OpEx. It sounded like you invested a bit more in the quarter, but some of the accelerated
investments you made in the hiring should start to normalize. So how should we think about the flexibility you have to invest if the
revenue outlook potentially is getting more constructive and the margin evolution?
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Rouven, you start with the revenue recognition.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes. And I maybe tackle the margin as well.
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Yes.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
You do the 2 others.
Okay. So on the subscription impact, so 13% growth in Q2, 18% growth in the third quarter. And the growth in the subscription line
is really driven by the run rate that we are building. There is no onetime impact or upfront component in the subscription line. It's all
reported under the license -- upfront license revenue. So as investors, what you have to expect is that the recurring and subscription
revenue should show continuous growth as we are transitioning our model.
I think one of the key takeaways of this quarter is that the transition to the subscription model is happening very fast. The large
transactions that we are signing are subscription deals. More and more are cloud-based as well, which allows us to have the 2
performance obligations to really have a ratable revenue recognition over the term of the contract. And we'll see that reflected in the
subscription revenue growth in the quarters to come because the large transactions that we signed, the majority of the value will be
recognized in the future periods. And what is in quarter is more the upfront component.
So the real value of what we will see in growth going forward is still to be recognized in future periods. That gives us a good visibility
also for Q4 and, I think, gives us a good starting point for 2024. So maybe that's to the subscription, which also partly addresses the
pipeline question and the visibility. But of course, there is also the upfront license to it.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2023 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 25, 2023
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11But I would like to refer now to the OpEx part. We had -- coming into the year, we had the top line more back-end loaded from a
revenue standpoint. And we, at the same point in time, had a strong investment cycle in 2022 that was carrying forward into 2023,
plus the impact of inflation. And you saw that in our first 6 months operating margin where we were lower than last year. And we
anticipated that starting Q3, we will catch up and that trend will reverse. And that's what we see reflected now. The cost increase
from the carryover of last year is now about 3%. It's less than 5%. It used to be 6% to 8% in the quarters before. So we are essentially
consuming that carryover effect, and it will be even less in Q4. This gives us the operating leverage to make investments. I mentioned
year-to-date, we hired 1,100 FTEs. So we are investing in the future while, at the same point in time, we are expanding our margin to
50 basis points, and we expect to further improve the margin in the fourth quarter because the carryover effect from last year will be
neutralized.
And the strong -- the acceleration of revenue, of course, does its part as well to help improve the margin in the second half of the year,
which then going forward, I think, sets us up nicely. Again, we have the flexibility, to your point, to manage the margin at around 40
to 50 basis points of improvement, which we already show in Q4 -- in Q3. Q4 will be better. On aggregate for the full year, we will be
still on target, which will be slightly down year-over-year. But for next year, we are projecting growth.
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Related to the pipeline, I think we have a decent number of large deals in the pipe, specifically in Transportation & Mobility and
Aerospace & Defense. As you can imagine, they are the one embracing at large the platform. And you remember last time I shared
with you the fact that the platform is really the standard in aerospace. And it is also the standard in the auto sector, specifically for the
electrical vehicles. So I think this is giving a lot of visibility. I will not mention the names, but I'm sure you have them in mind.
Related to MEDIDATA, I think there are a few things to consider. One is exactly what you say more the comp is not helping. And if
you remember, in Q3 last year, Rouven, correct me if I'm wrong, but it was 17%, right, the growth of MEDIDATA, which was by far
outperforming the market growth.
The second thing is we have a volume compression in terms of study starts on the market at large. And I was computing the data
recently. It's minus 13% for Q3 compared to Q3 last year, almost minus 10% since the beginning of the year. It's for the industry at
large. It's not only for us, of course. And more importantly, since you remember, the peak was doing at the COVID time, it's minus
14%. So why I'm seeing this? Because the vast majority are usually from those -- to these starts are coming from the CROs. And they
are the ones facing the volume drop for the time being. And as you may know, we have a larger exposure to the CROs, more than any
else -- anyone else, at least more than any of our competitors. So this is the reason why you have this adjustment.
Now let's speak about the competitiveness because I think this is what is behind the questions. I was checking the win rate is still at --
exceeding 80%. So clearly, we had a good win rate, and we are not suffering. I check also taking the large top customers we have, if
we have a significant drop of number of license, a number of trials or studies, this is not the case, right? And when we renew because
it's also an indicator, which is extremely important, are we renewing at parity or are we renewing with an extension of what we do.
And for Q3, the renewal was at 120%.
So all those indicators are extremely good. And another one, which is, I think, is also important for you, the total bookings increased
by a little bit less than 20%. Okay. This is the second piece of my answer.
The third piece, which is probably more important is, as I was stating in my comments, this market is changing, right? EDC was
invented 20 years ago. And EDC is nothing more than the PDM for clinical trial. And the platform is really coming. And the 2
fundamental things which are really reshaping this industry is the decentralization on one hand, and I took an example to explain
the reasons behind -- and you know that we are the one investing in this. We are the one leading the pack. And I can give you some
statistic about this.
If you take the top 20, more than half of them, have standardized their DCT, their decentralized clinical trial with patient cloud,
which is our dedicated solution for that, right? In Q3, we rescue 3 big DCT studies, was handled by competitors because they were
struggling to make it happen. So I would say on this front, we are not only leading the pack, but we are the one helping this industry to
be transformed.
If you look at AI, AI is also an interesting thing. I was telling you last time that AI is becoming more and more the norm also with the
DCT control arm. And right now, I think we have more than 50 large controlled arm studies running in parallel to the physical one,
to the traditional one. So this is really, again, something extremely important for you to keep in mind because this is shaping not only
what the industry will do but also where the growth is -- will come from. And if you look at the Patient Cloud, I mean the growth is --
I mean, it's by far exceeding 20% on a quarter-to-quarter.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2023 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 25, 2023

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12Last comment I will make, we have NEXT New York. NEXT is the big event for MEDIDATA. It's, I think, November 7 and 8. And
if you have few times, I will encourage you to at least connect if you cannot attend. Just to have a testimonial to have the people from
MEDIDATA and from Dassault Systèmes presenting this transformation, and you will understand why the confidence is there. And
as you say, Rouven, you will see automatic -- you will already see in Q4, the reacceleration because we are still planning to deliver
double-digit growth with MEDIDATA for the full year.
Adam Dennis Wood
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Adam Wood from Morgan Stanley. Maybe just to ask Mo's first question in a slightly different way. It's obviously great to see the
licenses in the quarter. I guess we're a bit accustomed to thinking of that as one-off revenue, but there's a lot of big deals in there with
subscription recurring in there as well. Is there any way to give some feel in terms of TCV signed in Q3, what that mix was? Are we
10%, 20%, 30% licenses? And any feel as to how derisked the recurring number is for the fourth quarter? Because I guess at this point
now, most of that revenue will be coming off the balance sheet rather than needing to be signed.
Secondly, on the JLR deal, it's great to have the updates in terms of the number of users. I mean just to give a feel in terms of revenue,
would that be a kind of similar revenue uplift as we saw when you signed that big standardization deal with Boeing? Is that the kind of
similar order of magnitude in terms of revenue uplift?
And then maybe finally on MEDIDATA. You talked specifically about MEDIDATA rather than Life Sciences recovering in the
fourth quarter. I guess the other unknown there is BIOVIA. Is that kind of lack of commentary and commitment on the BIOVIA side
just because you don't know because there's more volatile license business in there? Or are you actually expecting BIOVIA to still be
weak in the fourth quarter and dilute the growth?
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
The first part, Rouven. And then we'll take the other 2.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Thank you. Thank you for the additional question, Adam. So when we look combined at the total contract value of the top 6 deals we
signed this quarter, less than 15% is recognized in the quarter, and 85% or more will be recognized in the future. That will start in Q4.
But of course, that will be multiyears of revenue recognition to drive value. And that's the power of the subscription model and the
platform. That's why the value up strategy is so critical here. At these -- in many ways, these deals are starting points with the ability
to do more in the future. But the foundation is the subscription model, and the [ ratable ] revenue recognition.
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Speaking about GLR, yes, you're right, Adam, it's the same order of magnitude than Boeing on a yearly basis, except it's 5 years. It's
not 30 years.
Related to BIOVIA No, no, no. BIOVIA, we are moving to subscription as well. So it used to be a license model for the vast majority
of [ that ] we are doing, and we are moving to subscriptions. And the fact that I did not mention BIOVIA it's not because it's not
core. More than ever, against -- it's -- another thing I should add, the clinical trial is managed, to a certain extent, independently from
the research and discovery and the production. With the platform, we are connecting also the 2 together. And BIOVIA is extremely
instrumental in this industry, especially with the new techniques, which is generative AI, therapeutics solutions we are putting on the
market. The adoption by the market is extremely fast on this.
Unknown Analyst
Just a couple for me. Firstly, I know you love talking about 2024 at this stage of the year. But you've teased us with accelerating
subscription growth. Is there any reason why we shouldn't assume that you'll do double-digit software growth next year? Or are these
large deals creating tough comps that mean we should hold back some of our enthusiasm?
And then secondly, just on the cash flow. I know you said you're expecting Q4 cash to be higher than last year, but Q4 is not a
particularly high hurdle. Are you expecting, on a full year basis, cash flow to be higher than last year?
Rouven BergmannDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2023 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 25, 2023
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 13CFO & Executive VP
Yes. I'll start. Just to answer the second question. The answer is yes, it's for the full year. It's an operating cash flow improvement,
also an improvement in working capital that we expect in the fourth quarter. Remember, we signed some large transactions also this
quarter, and we'll see the benefit of this in the cash flow next quarter to come.
Related to the subscription acceleration, I think you see now the arc, right, from -- between the first half of the year. We also started
to guide to subscription beginning of the year in anticipation of the transition the trajectory we are on to give you the visibility of the
model transition that is underway. And the acceleration quarter-over-quarter sequentially from 13% to 18% is substantial. And for the
fourth quarter, if you look at the guidance range, it will be around 20% with the visibility we have.
Now related to next year, I think we've laid the foundation with all the elements of growth drivers that are in place across all segments
of our business. Also, the acceleration of MEDIDATA in 2024 will drive that from a year-over-year standpoint. In these numbers
of 18% in the third quarter, we have the muted MEDIDATA performance. That will improve. And so that will further support the
subscription growth in 2024.
I don't want to guide now to 2024. That's too early. We have important Q4 in front of us, where there's deals that similarly, like in Q3,
we are signing them in the fourth quarter, and they will fill our backlog for next year. And based on that visibility, then we'll give you
the transparency on what to expect, but the trend is clear.
Balajee Tirupati
Citigroup Inc., Research Division
Balajee Tirupati from Citi. Two from my side, if I may. Firstly, thanks for sharing color on MEDIDATA and competitive environment
there. One of your competitors for SOLIDWORKS has also recently talked about winning customers who assist us. So if you can talk
about competitive environment there in SOLIDWORKS.
And the other question would be on pricing. Dassault has been taking pricing action like other software companies this year. What is
the view going forward? And if you can share any color on how much of tailwind pricing is providing to revenue growth this year?
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Okay. I take SOLIDWORKS, and you will answer for the pricing.
So SOLIDWORKS, the main key highlight for the quarter is really the one I just highlight to you, which is the fact that the
subscription is really taking off, right? And 1/3 of the new booking is -- it means something, right, because by far, SOLIDWORKS is
#1 solution in the market. And when we speak about new booking, we are speaking about big numbers.
To just make a sanity check, I was looking at the number of units, which is always a good way to see if at the end, we are losing the
share or not. And in terms of number in units, we are still growing at the mid-single digit, right? So that's the reason why I think I'm
pretty confident about the fact that we continue to expand.
Overall, for the full year, we are talking about, I don't know, more than 80,000 new units, almost a little bit more than 20,000 per
quarter, just for you to have an idea, which could be compared to the competitors claiming that time to time, they are taking 1 unit on
their side.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Okay. So the pricing, thank you. You're right. We have -- I think we have a very good practice of evaluating our pricing power in
the market. In 2023, we made pricing adjustments in the range of 3% to 5% depending on geo and depending on product. What is
the contribution of this in 2023 itself? It's probably 1/3 that we see reflected because it takes time until -- depending on the timing of
renewal, it really varies. But so far, we are -- we have not seen pushback or challenges with this, and it's a sound approach.
For next year, we are carefully evaluating this also from a standpoint of affordability of various markets. It's a country-by-country
exercise to assess this. But yes, we are also looking at price increases for next year, but more to be shared in the future.
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
Okay. We can now take some questions from the call.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2023 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 25, 2023

[Operator Instructions] And now we're going to take our first question, and it comes from Toby Ogg from JPMorgan.
Toby Ogg
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Perhaps just again on the MEDIDATA side. I know you've talked about mid-single-digit growth there for MEDIDATA cloud
subscription revenue. But I know there's also a transactional component there to MEDIDATA. So could you help us just with the
overall growth for MEDIDATA in Q3? And then just thinking about the drivers of the confidence for the MEDIDATA reacceleration
into 2024 and beyond the level required to hit the cloud targets, could you perhaps just help us understand some of those building
blocks, I guess, just in the context of that more difficult environment?
And then lastly, just on the M&A and capital allocation. Could you just give us an update on what the latest thinking is here with
respect to any potential large transaction? And then just how you're balancing that with the midterm targets, which incorporate a
degree of M&A?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Sure. Thanks, Toby, for the questions. First on MEDIDATA, for the overall revenue, it's in line with cloud subscription. It's mid-
single digit. For the comp to come -- for the comp -- for the outlook on 2024 and the drivers of growth acceleration, clearly, we
highlighted the Patient Cloud and decentralization of clinical trials to be a very strong driver and transformational driver of clinical
trials in the future. The basics of -- the basis of EDC is transitioning from a site-centric approach to a patient-centric approach. And
that we are convinced it's going to drive more demand and our ability to grow and differentiate from our competitors.
We are the market leader in this space already. And for the reasons Pascal mentioned, we are confident that we are -- we will be able
to separate ourselves from the competition.
Also, around data AI, we have the richest and largest data set of clinical trial data, and we are recognized as leaders with synthetic
control arms, and this creates massive value for our clients. And we expect that the best is yet to come. We started with this journey.
And 2024 -- and the future will bring more and more evidence of the value of our data and how we can transform clinical trials. So
that's what's giving us the confidence. And we talked about the renewal rates, our strong foothold with our subscription customers, our
enterprise clients, where we have very successful renewals. We mentioned a few of them throughout this year, and we have a good
pipeline for Q4 as well.
What's really right now, and this is the comp question, the headwind we are facing is the volume compression because the industry
is going through a transformation. There was a search, and a number of clinical trials starts at the back of the COVID crisis, and this
trend is normalizing, and we are seeing that volume compression impacting us through our CRO partnerships. But that will normalize
over time as well and is, in part, will be reflected in our baseline when we move to 2024. But it's too early to say what the new norm
of clinical trial activity with the CRO will be. I think we need 1 or 2 more quarters of numbers to see the leveling of the CRO growth
profile, which will have an impact on our performance.
But overall, we are in a position of strength. And we defend our market share, also evidence in the win rates and in some competitive
takeaways that Pascal was referring to on the Patient Cloud side.
Now your last question on M&A and capital allocation. Very clear, we have improved our net cash position significantly this year.
We have a strong cash balance. We are -- we -- you know our 5-year commitment to double EPS by 2028. There's a strong organic
component. There is a strong conviction that the 3DEXPERIENCE platform is significantly expanding the value we create with
clients, and you see it represented in the type of size of transactions we are making. Of course, M&A has always been a catalyst for us,
and it will continue to be, and it's going to have a long-term impact -- mid- to long-term impact to further add to our growth, but we
are focused on the organic growth. And I think the third quarter reflects that the strategy is working.
Operator
And the next question comes from the line of Nicolas David from ODDO BHF.
Nicolas David

Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15I have 2, actually. The first one is when I look at the Q4 license growth, which is to be low single-digit constant currency, is it mainly
reflecting the impact of the move to subscription? Or are you also factoring some -- the fact that some deals might be pulled forward
in Q3 from Q4? And also, did you take into account some potential softness into the underlying demand?
And my second question is regarding SOLIDWORKS, I appreciate the details regarding the new bookings on the cloud. But if could
you share more details in terms of the phasing of this move to subscription and notably the impact this will have on the top line. First,
should we expect deeper impact in the coming quarters or Q3 was already a good example of what we should see? And how long
should we see this impact? And what do you think about the acceleration and the multiplication effect -- multiplicator effect of this
mode of subscription on a typical deal or typical set of deals?
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
That was subscription, the first question.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
The first question, so on the license part, Nicolas, thank you for the question and the opportunity to clarify this. So for Q4, the license
at minus 1% to plus 3% growth really reflects the discipline we have to be focused on our full year plan. We knew we had a strong
second half of the year coming into the year. That was the reason why the year was more back-end loaded. Q3 had a good -- very good
license. But Q4, it's more of a normal trajectory of what to expect in license revenue and go forward, but still growing. That's what
we expect. And it's off a strong comparison base of last year. So -- but there's no softness -- potential softness or there's also no pull
forward from Q4 to Q3 that we had. So it's a normal trend that for the second half of the year that we have reflected in our guidance.
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
SOLIDWORKS, maybe I can say a few words about this. Again, the move to subscription is -- needs to be connected with the fact
that the market has also adopted the 3DEXPERIENCE SOLIDWORKS approach, which is how we connect SOLIDWORKS with
the platform and with the cloud. So why I'm saying this because you have additional revenue coming from this. You have obviously
the cloud space, and we are pricing this. And why so? Because this is creating value for the customer. And we also have the access to
the platform, which is an extension of what SOLIDWORKS is doing. So the trends to subscription is not only a trend in the business
model, but it's a trend also by the nature of the solutions being adopted by the market being a little bit different.
So why I'm saying this because at the end, the fact that we are moving from a license to a subscription model is also linked to the fact
that we are expanding the value we do for our customers, and to a certain extent, we are also expanding the revenue coming from the
SOLIDWORKS installed base.
Nicolas David
ODDO BHF Corporate & Markets, Research Division
And in terms of acceleration, when do you expect this to pay off? Already in '24? Or is it too early?
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Again, if you look at the broad base view on SOLIDWORKS, I think we are growing nicely in many, many countries. I mean, for
sure, for the largest one, but also, for example, like in India, the momentum is extremely high for SOLIDWORKS as well. So more
than ever, I'm confident.
Remember, if you step back, you still have millions of people still working in 2D. Believe me or not, we have not yet finished the
migration from 2D to 3D. So every year, it's almost 5% of those millions installed base which are migrating to 3D, and we are still
continuing to capture more than half of this. So the fundamentals are here in order to continue to do the value wide. But in addition,
that's what Rouven was explaining. We are building the value up on top of the SOLIDWORKS installed base, and this is related to my
previous comments.
So if you combine 2 [ axis ] -- I mean we are still confident on the -- as we say, the high single-digit growth for SOLIDWORKS.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16Okay. Congrats from my side for those great results.
Operator
Now we're going to take our next question that comes from the line of Laurent Daure from Kepler Cheuvreux.
Laurent Daure
Kepler Cheuvreux, Research Division
Congratulations from my end as well. I have 3 quick questions, please. The first is you alluded briefly on China and the visibility
you're having for the months to come. If you could elaborate a little bit on this.
My second one is on the different verticals you stressed on the ones that are performing extremely strongly. But do you have other
verticals in Life Sciences that are, for the time, a little bit weaker?
And my final question is coming back to your June CMD and your aspiration to grow 10% organic on average for the years to come,
do you still see the same breakdown of the growth? Or would it be fair to say that maybe you could grow a little less on Life Sciences
and compensate that with product like Centric PLM that are doing even better than what you thought? Or is the situation the same as a
couple of months back?
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Okay. Thank you, Laurent, for the questions. Let's come back to China. I think you remember the story at the beginning of the year.
You were almost blaming us. We were too careful with the Chinese forecast at that time.
Now I will tell you the opposite. I have much more confidence, and I have the pipeline. And I see the momentum, again, 6% this
quarter. I'm relatively confident we could be, if not double-digit but close to double digit for Q4, right? And why? So, there is a
fundamental reason. Whatever the economic situations China is facing, this country is investing a lot in innovation on multiple fronts.
And to a certain extent, we are benefiting from this huge investment cycle they do.
From a vertical standpoint, if you look at since the beginning of the year, I mean, it's relatively consistent. I mean the core industry,
whatever -- it's the Transportation & Mobility, Aerospace & Defense, industrial equipment are growing in line with basically
the growth of Dassault Systèmes. Consumer Packaged Goods and consumer goods is starting to take off not only from a growth
standpoint, but also it's material for Dassault Systèmes, which is an expansion of what the manufacturing industry is about.
Life Sciences, we spoke about it, but again Life Sciences, it's not only Dassault Systèmes MEDIDATA. It's Dassault Systèmes
BIOVIA. It's Dassault Systèmes DELMIA. It's Dassault Systèmes ENOVIA, all the other brands. And this piece is also increasing.
You remember, I told you many times that the biologics are really changing the way to produce. And we have large deals in the pipes.
People are considering the entire manufacturing solutions in order to basically rethink the way to produce.
The last comment, which is related to -- if on the long-term plan, we are, to a certain extent, offsetting part of the Life Sciences growth
expected by something else, the answer is no for the reason I just mentioned to you. The Life Sciences strategy of Dassault Systèmes
is not only dependent on Dassault Systèmes MEDIDATA. It's the entire set of solutions we are providing for this market, which are
the one you should take into consideration.
So that's what I can say.
Operator
And now we'll take our next question from Frederic Boulan from Bank of America.
Frederic Emile Alfred Boulan
BofA Securities, Research Division
So first of all, if we could spend a bit of time on the cloud, if you could discuss appetite you're seeing for -- you got solutions, 10%
growth in Q3 was a bit underwhelming, I guess, largely driven by MEDIDATA. But if you could discuss the traction outside of
MEDIDATA, what type of offering customers are going for.
Second, on AI engine, you talked a lot about embedding AI in your portfolio. If you can discuss a little bit your road map and any
difference in opportunity you see for customers using your software on-prem versus in the cloud?DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2023 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 25, 2023
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 17And then lastly, a follow-up on the previous questions around MEDIDATA. Can you discuss a little bit what you're seeing in terms of
competitive behavior? So from a pricing standpoint or commercial aggressivity, and then what kind of assumptions are you taking on
the trials end market for next year when you talk about that improvement you're expecting at MEDIDATA?
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Okay. Start with the cloud.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Frederic, yes, thank you for the question. On the cloud, 10% growth this quarter. I mentioned we expect this also to accelerate. It was
impacted by the lower contribution from MEDIDATA. For outside of MEDIDATA, the cloud growth is strong, and the acceleration
with some of the transactions we signed this quarter, we will see that in quarters to come in next quarter.
What's really at the core of this cloud growth is the 3DEXPERIENCE platform. And here across all the segments from smaller
clients where we talked about SOLIDWORKS cloud but also for 3DEXPERIENCE cloud transformation of large OEMs. You're
familiar with the Renault story. And now we are starting a new story with JLR, and we have several large customers who are using the
3DEXPERIENCE platform in the cloud. And you know that from a product road map standpoint, all our roles, all our processes are
cloud -- available as cloud solutions. And this gives us the opportunity now to really go into the market and offer our clients the right
to use with their subscriptions, the cloud and on-premise based on their flexible needs. And this makes the cloud transition very simple
for our large customers. That's a big advantage. And I expect that to be an unlocking event for 2024. As we, more and more, will have
those type of agreements that will help us to adopt the cloud within our customer base and accelerate cloud growth.
Pascal Daloz
Deputy CEO, COO & Director
Following the question on MEDIDATA. Again, we -- I gave the statistic of the industry. Just for you to figure how much compared to
the peak we are right now. And my expectation for 2024 will maybe normalize in terms of the growth for the number of new studies.
And we are back to where we used to be, which is between 5% to 7%. That's the underlying assumptions because, I mean, the peak
has been basically absorbed, and we are back to a stabilized situation.
Relating to the pricing, the way we do pricing at Dassault Systèmes is related to the value we are creating for the customers. And
this is a good question because there is a battle going on with newcomers. We need to drop the price and, to a certain extent, try to
commoditize things. That's the reason why, again, I was insisting on the fact that if you believe into the patient centricity, if you
believe in the fact that AI is a way to shrink dramatically the time to do the trial, you are changing the equation.
For the one, we are not the expert. Remember, the clinical trial are the most, I mean, expensive phase in the drug development. So
each time you can reduce it, it's a significant game, not only from a time-to-market standpoint but from an investment standpoint. And
that's really how we are building our plan for the coming years.
Related to AI, again, I say already a lot, I think AI start with the data set. Remember this all the time. If you do not have the data sets,
there is little things you can do. And in our space, the data sets are pretty complex. It's not transactions. [ We're not ] speaking about
this, we are speaking about knowledge and know-how. And it's a difficult thing to handle if you are not expert. And I think the fact
that, as Bernard was mentioning, I mean, AI is something we have introduced in our solution a long time ago. I mean it's maybe not
visible from you guys, but from our users, it is. And we believe in the combination of the different techniques to serve the problem.
Why so? Because if you try to solve everything with an AI-based approach, maybe you will have a more expensive way to do things
we are currently doing in a nice way with modeling and simulation. So we should use AI on specific use cases where the approach
we are currently using is not giving a proper answer. And that's the reason why I was mentioning those elements, which is how you
empower the users with new capabilities, especially when you have to do a complex synthesis or when you have to navigate in the
unknown when things are becoming unpredictable, you need all the time in real time to evaluate all the different options you have in
order to guide your decision process. And that's really what AI is about for us.
In the context again, where the virtual twin is now connected to the -- what we call the real-world evidence, where the products are
used, we are connecting the real-time of information, and we are dealing with it, and we are extracting insight using the AI techniques
to make it happen. So that's the things. And I believe more than ever, it's a way to expand what we do more than to reduce what we do
from a value proposal standpoint.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2023 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 25, 2023

Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
I'm Beatrix Martinez, Dassault Systèmes VP Investor Relations. And from the company, we have Bernard Charlès, Executive
Chairman, joining us remotely; Pascal Daloz, CEO; and Rouven Bergmann, CFO.
I would like to welcome you to Dassault Systèmes Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 earnings presentation.
[Operator Instructions]
Dassault Systèmes results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. Most of the financial figures in this presentation, conference call are
presented on a non-IFRS basis with revenue growth rates in constant currencies, unless otherwise noted. For an understanding of the
differences between the IFRS and the non-IFRS, please see the reconciliation tables included in our press release.
Some of the comments we will make during today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements, which could differ
materially from actual results. Please refer to our risk factors in our 2022 document -- universal registration documents published on
March 17, 2023.
I will now hand over to Pascal Daloz.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Thank you, Beatrix. Good morning, good afternoon to everyone. It's always a pleasure to be with you at this time of the year, not only
because it's the yearly results, but it's also a way to kick off the year. So thank you for joining, again.
So if we move to the 2023 and let's go straight to the points. We have delivered a revenue growth of 9%. And I think this growth is
built on the momentum coming from the subscriptions. And you can see an increase of the subscriptions of 16% accelerating over the
year because we are -- and Rouven will give more details, but we are lending at 22% growth for Q4 for the subscription.
At the same time, we have also delivered our profitability objective, achieving an operating income of 32.4%, while we continue to
invest in our future, and we have a net hiring of 1,300 people this year. And on top of this, I think we have achieved our EPS objective
of EUR 1.2, up 12%.
The key point is beyond these financial achievements, I think today marks a special moment, and let me share a few key points.
Firstly, 2023 reflect the successful delivery of our 2018-2023 plan, the 5-year plan, where we had an objective to double the EPS to
EUR 1.20. And this performance was achieved as originally planned despite the pandemic, which has an impact, if you remember, we
are almost flat for a year, and we have been able to recover this. And despite also the geopolitical instability, including the fact that we
have almost suspended the entire operation in Russia.
Secondly, I think it's also provided a very solid platform to embark our new 5-year plan to double EPS again to reach EUR 2.4 in
2028. And thirdly, I think this moment mark also an evolution in our governance, and I will come back to this and expansion of our
horizon. In other words, I think today marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter for the company.
So first, I think I'm honored to take the role of Chief Executive Officer on January 1, 2024. Some of you remember me, 25 years ago,
I was sitting in the -- with you guys. I made a long trip with Dassault Systèmes. And I think now I'm ready and proud to build on the
heritage of Bernard Charlès. And you can see on this picture, I think Bernard was in a deal we shared for a very long time. And our
plan is to recreate the deal for the next -- we put 3 points, so at least the next maybe 20 years.
It has been an inspiration behind Dassault Systèmes strategic move and transforming the industry. And Bernard has guided the
company from a start-up to a global leader. So I think we have been working together for almost 25 years now. And I learn a lot from
Bernard. In my different positions, you can see, talking from the strategy, expanding to the brands, managing the product line to
finance in '18, becoming the Chief Operating Officer, the deputy CEO and now the CEO of the company.
And for all those this journey, I really want to thank Bernard for his trust and also for the guidance he gives me to build this journey
over the time.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 01, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 5I think the most important, we share the same visions of virtualizing the world and helping our customers to harmonize the product
nature and life, and we are committed really to make this happen for all the industries we serve.
I think Bernard is now Dassault Systèmes Executive Chairman. And every day, you can conform him to energize the company with
his amazing talent to imagine and shape the future. So I know Bernard, you are connected. Maybe you want to say a few words?
Bernard S. Charles
Executive Chairman
Yes. Thank you. Hello, everyone. And thank you very much Pascal for your warm word. I have to say that I'm impressed with Pascal's
engagement to bring value to the giant customer base we have. And this is the most important thing, always what we have been doing
since the inception as a system, has built a solid long-lasting foundation on a long-term view, both in relationship with clients and the
way we work with them. Therefore, Pascal and his team is really ready to do the same value creation for this large customer base that
is our heritage. So I am in a good position as Pascal said, to follow [indiscernible] and Charles Edelstenne on really the track record,
hopefully.
So what will I do in my new role? First, as Pascal said, as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, I will ensure the executive
team enjoys the same freedom to pursue innovative strategy as I had for so many years. I will, of course, also bring ideas to the
strategy, on the research team, so they can integrate them if they want and Dassault Systèmes continue to have the best business
reputation connecting with global institution on selected friends from the customer base with whom I enjoy long lasting, strong
relationship. So it's really a joy for me to do the deal with Pascal.
Over the past years of my professional life, I have been motivated by a constant commitment to inspire -- inspiring significant
transformation of the industry, and we are at the top. And I think that this is so crucial even more today for health, mobility, energy on
many other sector of the economy to reimagine a new balance of innovation with responsibility towards nature and society.
We have always been a key player in some way for the last 40 years to redefine what the industry could do and help them go there. I
think industry is an important part of the society. Our legacy, combining science and industry knowledge, is crucial therefore, for the
upcoming transformation. We call it the metamorphosis that should apply to all those industries to be more sustainable. And I think
that the genes of Dassault Systèmes lies on its ability to translate a dream into reality and to drive science-guided imagination.
There is more to be invented to advance our mission. In the last 3 years, Pascal and I had a special moment to grow the future of
Dassault Systèmes and to establish the strongest possible base to imagine 2040 horizon. So I know and I wish you, Pascal and all your
team, the best good luck. And back to you.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Thank you very much, Bernard. And again, thank you for continuing to work in the role to continue to develop this fantastic company,
which is Dassault Systèmes. So 2024 marked an important stage in our strategy as we are introducing these new horizons. We call it
the generative economy. And this is the horizon for 2040.
Indeed, I think we anticipate that the global economy is entering in a new era as the experience economy and the sustainability -- the
sustainability of the sustainable economy, I should say, are converging. And I think we aim to be the catalyst and the enabler to make
this new generative economy a reality.
So for Dassault Systèmes and also for our customers, I think we will create new possibilities in terms of market audience portfolio,
just as we did a decade ago with 3DEXPERIENCE. Remember in 2012, we stated that product is not longer enough. And we open up
the experience economy center on the product usage. We define experience as an extended view of the products taking into account
the context of use.
And in 2020, we went a step further. We declared that we are shifting from dreams to life. And we extended the virtual
3DEXPERIENCE to the living organisms, including the human being, and this was opening a new market for us.
In 2024, I think it's time for us to accelerate the shift from live to things, but we also need to better life of things. And this is the
driving principle of what we call the generative economy.
So what does generative means? It's not generative AI. It means that generative is the method of life. Imagine self-healing materials,
imagine customers that can grow product rather than manufacture them. Imagine net positive business model giving as much as backDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 01, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 6to the society, sorry, than what they take away. I think this is what we put behind the generative. So generative for us is a solution to
consumptions.
And you know that the consumption model is not sustainable because customers just cannot afford to consume resources and energy
that tend to be scarce or at price. And the belief we have is the industry can be the solution for the sustainability. It's not the problem.
As soon as we can reach a new balance, and this is the reason why we have the strong conviction that all the industry will have to go
to this metamorphosis, change the way they operate in order to be much more sustainable.
And we have and we are mission-critical for the businesses to imagine, create, deliver generative experience for their consumers, their
patients, their workers, their citizens and at large, the society.
This metamorphosis cannot be achieved by leveraging the virtual world to improve the real world. And virtualization is really the
catalyst and the enabler for the generative economy.
Now I think we want to push our virtual twin approach that is virtual twin experience approach a step further. Let me give you a few
examples. When you speak about mobility, it's not only about device. It's about environments involving passengers, vehicles, building,
air qualities. When we speak about cancer, it's not only about the cell. It's also the effect on an organic process.
So for all of this, I think we have to connect many virtual twin together. And this is what we call universes. Each universes, to make
simple, it's a combination of family of virtual twin experience. And we call it universes because we unify multiple virtual twins. They
unify all the stakeholders, they unify the knowledge and the know-how. And unlike the metaverse, we are not creating a parallel work.
Unlike the Omniverse, we do not want to create a world of controlling everything. With universe, what we want to do is simply unify
the virtual and the real in order to reveal the world of possibility and generate the experience.
So the question at this stage is probably what is -- or what are our levers? And to summarize it, I think it's relatively easy. It's only one
word is make it full loop. Why so? Because if full loop is really the method for building the universes.
For 40 years, Dassault Systèmes has the pool of innovations which is the left side of the slide by guiding innovations from design to
manufacturing to product introductions and so on. Today, we are expanding this gourmet into an infinite loop by seamless connecting
the virtual and the real with the real world data. And this is really opening up new possibilities such as giving life to the things.
So when the virtual twin is connecting with the real flow of data automatically, you are giving life to the virtual object. We are also
generating multiple life of the things. So giving life to the thing means that we are pouring by the real world of data, our virtual twin,
in order to transform them into a multidimension if you want. Imagine the car today, they can monitor and optimize the real life of the
car with their virtual counterparts.
In addition, I think we can give possibility for things to have multiple life because the waste are becoming resources for new products.
This is the basis of the new generation of product life cycle, the PDM, if you want, of the 21st century.
And I think we have invented the product life cycle management in the '80s. I think now we want to generate multiple cycle of life for
the things. And doing so, we aim to leverage the power of the numbers in order to broaden our value proposal, to extend the audience
we can reach to all the business users to the consumer, to the patient and to the citizens and for all the physical objects to have a virtual
twin attached to it.
So this is substantially broadening of our addressable market. You remember during the Capital Market Day, I was making this
statement that our addressable market or total addressable market is expanding to not only more EUR 100 billion, but trillions because
you could assume that all the physical objects, all the things surrounding you will have their virtual counterparts. And this will be used
real time to do things. That's the bet we are making for this long-term horizon.
Now let's move on the successful delivery of the 2018-2023 plan, doubling the EPS. And why I want to spend a few times because
they are also highlighting some fundamental transformation that have occurred in the past 5 years.
First, we have doubled the EPS but with interesting balance between the organic and the inorganic growth. And you can see that
2/3 is coming from the organic growth. So do not conclude that we have achieved our plan because we made significant investment
acquiring MEDIDATA or CENTRIC PLM. They are contributing, but the vast majority is coming from decision we took long time
ago. And one of them is the 3DEXPERIENCE platform. Remember, the 3DEXPERIENCE platform I've been introducing on the
market since 2012.
In the last 5 years, we have simply doubled the incremental contribution of the 3DEXPERIENCE platform to the growth. Now is -- it
represents a yearly around EUR 1 billion -- a little bit more than EUR 1 billion.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 01, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7The second thing, I think, is the cloud. And remember, when we started in 2018, many of you doubt about our ability to move to
the cloud. We have multiplied the contribution of the cloud revenue by 40x from EUR 30 million to EUR 1.2 billion. There is a
significant part coming from MEDIDATA for sure, but the rest is growing extremely fast at a triple digit.
The last point, which is probably the most important because it was the title of the press release, which is, I think we are embracing
at large the subscription business model. And over the last 5 years, we have multiplied by 4, the contributions to the subscription
revenue, and now we are a little bit less than EUR 2 billion.
So -- and finally, I think the most important also for the future, I think we have completely deleveraged the company, and we have
been able to reimburse the significant checks we signed for the acquisition of MEDIDATA in the 3 years. And now we are starting
with a net cash positive situation at EUR 600 million, which is giving us room to maneuver. That's one side of the equation.
The second one, which I think is probably more important, we act as a game changer in many, many industries. And as a result, you
can see either we have reinforced our position or we have established very strong dominant position in segments where we have
almost no footprint a few years ago. And this is, as you can see, the dividends in the EV segment. We have now a stronger presence
than we used to have in the traditional thermal vehicles.
It's also the case in licenses where we had, you remember, limited presence. Now we are becoming extremely dominant. And in
the infrastructure and cities, we are still a challenge. Nevertheless, if you look at our strategy, we are focusing on very high-growth
segments and the nuclear is one of them with the vast majority of the projects around the globe being developed with our solutions
right now.
Now let's step in, in the generative economy because we want to continue to be the game changer. And for that, we are obviously
betting on significant changes or transformation happening in the 3 sectors of the economy we want to serve.
Starting with the manufacturing industry. I think this sector represents a volume of over 40 million companies worldwide. This market
is enormous when you think about it. And it's far from being saturated. So despite everything you can read, despite every statement
that could be made by a certain competitor, we have the largest install base with 350,000 competitors. The manufacturing sector by
itself is representing almost 300,000. It's only 2% of the penetration of the market.
The second thing is if you project yourself by 2030, you have a little bit more than 1.3 billion people will move into the upper class.
Why? It's a benefit for the society, but there is a downside also for this, which is the environmental impact. Because it's an imperative
for the manufacturing sector to transform itself to continue to offer product and experience to consumer, while at the same time, we
are preserving the environment. Those are really fundamental, I would say, trend we want to capitalizing to develop and continue to
enlarge our footprint.
In the life sciences and health care sector, I think our mission aligns collectively well with the preciousness of the life itself. Today,
you have 8 billion people on Earth, and our goal is really to extend beyond treating the illness and to be much more focusing on
sustaining, if you want, the overall health, moving from cure to care. And I think the generative economy represents a real opportunity
to forge new partnerships to the real data scientist therapeutic innovation to pioneer groundbreaking medical care experiences, address
complex challenges like chronic diseases, aging population, the global health issues. And this is really what we want to do to redefine
this still fragmented market with a new game-changing approach.
In infrastructure and city sector, environment is relatively simple. The biggest challenge is decarbonation. Given the fact that these
sectors by itself represent 2/3 of the global carbon emissions. So as a consequence, sustainability has gained a lot of prominence, I
would say, in governmental and corporate agenda with the commitment to triple the nuclear capacity to shift toward clean energy
investments, to innovate in new materials, to change the technique -- the construction technique in order to enhance the energy
efficacy of the building. So those are many things happening in these sectors. And I think we stand ready to contribute significantly to
achieving this ambition goal in the sectors.
To highlight this, I think there are recent customer case I want to use, highlighting the -- what is happening in the 3 sectors of the
economy. The first one is BMW. And I'd like to start with the manufacturing industries and especially to focus on transportation and
mobility because you know that our 3DEXPERIENCE platform has gained a lot of momentum and we have one many, many -- I
could share in the last few years.
Just to give you some things, just only in 2023, we signed significant contracts in transportation and mobility. Jaguar Land Rover,
Orono, Tarek Sherif, Ford, Honda, even General Motors, just to name a few. This quarter, I think we are extremely proud to announce
that BMW has selected the 3DEXPERIENCE platform for its future engineering platform. And it's extending our long relationshipDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 01, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8we have with them because we started a long time ago. They had already 405 customers. And now we are expanding for the next 10
years.
And as Rouven was mentioning to me this morning, if I -- they wanted to sign a 20-year agreement with us, but we said let's focus on
the 10 years first. And this is a major success, especially if you consider that this client remain in Germany, a pioneer in the enterprise-
wide adoption of the 3DEXPERIENCE platform.
The strategic move involved a sustainable increase of the number of users. And you know if you have a chance to discuss with the
BMW people, they will -- they recognize us by the wide usage of CATIA V5, 3,000 people using CATIA V5 within BMW. And with
this plan, we want to expand to 17,000 3DEXPERIENCE users over the time. So it's really a game-changing thing.
And this number, for me, it's an evidence of our ability to expand through our engineering platform across the multiple discipline.
Another game changer is really the ability to address the complexity of the connected, the autonomous vehicle engineering.
Remember, between an EV car and a traditional car, you only have 10% pieces in common.
The rest is brand new. And we want to do this with a new concept, which is to deliver a personalized experience. And I think in
addition, BMW is also aiming to reduce the engineering to manufacturing cycle time. And it was an interesting thing because they
did a lot of benchmark. The benchmark almost all the solution on markets. And during this evaluation, just to take an example, we
were able to demonstrate that for the chassis between the cycle, between the engineering and the manufacturing loop, it used to take 4
days, and now we are capable to do it in 3 minutes. So this is really a game-changer and this again demonstrates our ability to reshape
completely the processes.
But beyond this financial point, I think the most important is our ability to be game-changer in this industry where the new
paradigm is emerging as the software-defined vehicles is becoming the norm. And I think most of the automakers are adopting the
3DEXPERIENCE platform to create this personal experience I was mentioning.
And the value we bring goes far beyond the platform and far beyond the collection of functionality. And that's the reason why on the
slide, usually, I like to put the name of the solutions, Global Modular Architecture, smart, safe and connected, efficient and multi-
energy platform. Those are the challenge -- the challenges the industry needs to fix.
But it's not all. I think if we move to the Life Sciences, there is something new happening. It's really groundbreaking. It's the
application of the virtual twin in the drug development. You remember when we come together with MEDIDATA, it was the bet. But
at some point of time, the virtual twin will become a norm in this industry. And now we start to have the real kick.
Biogen, you know them, it's an American biotech, and they have chosen the 3DEXPERIENCE platform on the cloud to develop the
new drug for neurological disease. And this is interesting because it involves the modeling and the simulation of the drug and at the
same time, the delivery to the breakthrough injection.
And why it's an interesting case because the steps include creating a virtual twin of the brain and the spiral columns to understand
the drug delivery using the twin that you have in the spin-up, the terrible spin-up. And this is extremely important because this is
avoiding preclinical in vivo testing, and it helps also to determine the optimal location for the injections for the drugs in order to reach
a difficult area, which is the brain.
It's a breakthrough because, again, we are pushing the boundary of what is really possible. And we are connecting 2 virtual twins
together, one for the drugs, the other one for the brain and the spiral column and to validate the effect. And I think this is a good
example of what we call universes, right? Remember, the universes is really how you connect virtual twin together in order to have the
360-degree view, if you want, of the new experience you want to provide.
Moving to Infrastructure & Cities. I think we also had some interesting win this quarter. And I took this one, steel. Why steel?
Because steel is still a ubiquitous -- I mean, it's a prime example of the materials with significant impact on the environment. And steel
is used in many industries, such as construction, automotive, and it contributes to -- significantly to the carbon emission.
So this is why H2 Green has chosen us to become, I would say, the backbone of steel production, reducing by 95% their CO2
emissions, their CO2 footprint. And this is clearly underscores, if you want, the role of the decarbonation as a driving force for this
sector to adapt our solutions.
Now to conclude, and before to hand over to Rouven, let me wrap up. First, we embarked on a new 5 years' plan. And once again,
the idea is to double again the EPS by 2028. I think we are well positioned, strategically speaking, to leverage the vast market we are
creating with this new horizon, the generative economy. And I think we have many, many opportunities to continue to expand.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 01, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9Third, I think we are differentiating ourselves in the market by combining our scientific approach with the industrial know-how and
to a certain extent, we are very unique in the software industry. And we are also differentiating ourselves by coupling, if you want, the
simulation and the modeling technologies with Generative AI. And I think this is setting us apart to play a critical role to tackle these
opportunities we have in front of us.
So now it's time for Rouven to come on stage and to say a few words about Q4 and the full year performance and also the outlook for
Q1. Rouven, you have the floor.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Thank you, Pascal. Thank you, and welcome also from my side to all of you here in Paris and to everybody listening to this online. Let
me turn our discussion now to our fourth quarter performance across our geos and our product lines.
You see Europe had an excellent quarter and year with 15% growth and 14% growth, respectively. And most importantly, the growth
was broad-based, and it was driven across industries and multiple end markets with double-digit growth driven in Euro West, in Euro
North and also in Euro Central.
Specifically, as you heard from Pascal before, we had a strong positive shift in momentum of 3DEXPERIENCE adoption [ by
turbine ] by BMW and Bosch, expanding our relationships in the fourth quarter.
In the Americas, our revenue in 2023 was up 7% for the year, while Q4 was rather muted due to a strong baseline comparison. The
growth dynamics, however, in the Americas remain very resilient and were evident with strong growth in T&M and Aerospace with
Ford signing a new 3DEXPERIENCE deal and Lockheed Martin expanding the usage of the 3DEXPERIENCE platform.
In 2023, the Americas region shifted fast to embrace the subscription model. And in fact, subscription has surpassed upfront license
revenue by a factor of almost 2 on top of MEDIDATA. This is providing a strong basis for future expansions in this region.
In Asia, revenue growth was 3% for the year and mainly impacted by the volatility, which we experienced in China in the first half
of 2023. The second half, however, and despite continued challenging macroeconomic conditions, we experienced growth in China,
growth actually accelerated. It is evidenced by an upward trend of 6% growth in Q3 and a strong 14% growth in Q4. For the year, the
growth in China was resilient at 5%. India delivered a growth of 18%. And Japan and Korea were rather soft.
Now let's review our product line performance. Industrial Innovation delivered an outstanding result with double-digit growth for the
year and in Q4, representing now 54% of our software revenue. As evidenced by the strong numbers, 3DEXPERIENCE is delivering
the multiplier effect accelerating the growth in CATIA, SIMULIA and DELMIA. They're all up double digit throughout the year,
while our Data Science business is accelerating to even 20% for the year.
In 2023, the subscription revenue surpassed the growth, contributing from the -- in 2023, the subscription revenue surpassed the
growth contribution from upfront license revenue. We see the strong momentum in subscription costs here.
For Mainstream Innovation, we reported 7% growth, and now it represents 24% of total stock of revenue. I would like to draw your
attention on 2 key drivers. First, the SOLIDWORKS business model, it is accelerating the shift to subscription, highlighted by almost
triple-digit growth year-over-year. The annual run rate for subscription has reached EUR 100 million in revenue and is at a speed to
double again.
Second, we are redefining the PLM category for the consumer industries. The momentum of CENTRIC PLM is gaining strength again
in Q4 and is delivering a record 2023. We are now signing a large enterprise-level deals. We spoke about Audi and Decathlon on
previous calls. And this quarter, we signed multimillion-dollar deals with iconic brands such as [ Wilson, Fila and Pitibato ].
In Life Sciences, revenue or 6% for the year accounted for 22% of total revenue. And in the quarter, the 2% growth is mainly
associated with 2 effects. First, a high comparison base; and secondly, the slowdown in study starts as discussed over the last quarter.
However, brought into note, the total revenue of MEDIDATA for the full year 2023 was up 10%. This includes services revenue,
adding about 3 points of growth on top of the software revenue. These are high value-added services related to the design, launch and
conduct of studies, including operating decentralized clinical trials.
It's a kind of a service as a software, a model that we put in place during COVID to scale mega trials. We continue to support sponsors
such as Moderna and partner in this model.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 01, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10Now let's zoom in to discuss the volume impact of clinical trials start and associated market share in a bit more detail. This should
help you to better frame the path of how we will reaccelerate towards double-digit growth in the future.
Overall, since the peak of COVID, volumes in clinical trial starts have declined by about 5% in '22 and 10% in 2023. Essentially, we
are now back to the trend line of 2019 growth, and the COVID bubble is behind us, as you see in the chart on the left top.
Important to highlight, in this period of volume compression, we actually gained market share of approximately 1 point on average for
new study starts and about 4 points for the large-scale pivotal Phase III trial. However, despite these ongoing market share gains, the
strong volume reduction in 2022 and 2023 impacts the overall growth of MEDIDATA, which is visible in the 2023 software revenue
number.
As you project 2024, we expect volumes to return to normal to pre-pandemic growth levels. However, as for the revenue growth,
we still need to absorb the volume compression residing from the COVID bubble because changes in volume of study start typically
convert to revenue with a 6- to 12-month delay.
In 2025, this volatility in revenue will be behind us in the asset to return to double-digit cost. We have a strong basis. We are winning
market share. We are science-based. We offer the most comprehensive platform to design, launch and conduct advanced trials.
On top, we are expanding our share of wallet through AI, decentralized trials and integrating data management with a larger healthy
ecosystem. This positions us clearly as the leader as evidenced by the fact that 75% of novel drugs have been developed with our
technology, as you heard from Pascal before.
Now let's switch to the mainstream opportunity. In 2023, CENTRIC PLM continued its path of establishing its global leadership
position. With 120 customer wins in 2023, including the largest 2 deals in its history in 2023 of Audi and Decathlon, CENTRIC PLM
has confirmed its strong diversification, which goes way beyond fashion and apparel with strong wins in outdoor and sports, food and
beverage, cosmetics and consumer electronics. By expanding from brands to retailers, it also opens a path to future expansion towards
communities.
As you can see, we are well positioned to continue to execute on our strategy of building a significant course opportunity. CENTRIC
PLM is not just collections management. We're expanding to a business platform that serves as a backbone for e-commerce.
Consequently, the growth potential is significant with a path of creating a $1 billion-plus business in a new category of PLM.
Now let's transition and review the financials for the quarter and for the full year for the company. We delivered on all our financial
targets in 2023. Total revenue grew 9% and EPS 12%, showing the anticipated acceleration in the second half. This is evidenced by
Q4 recurring revenue up 12%, driven by strong momentum in subscription revenue growth of 22%. These results underscore our
commitment to evolve our business model towards subscription, aiming to increase the share of predictable revenue.
Subscription revenue now accounts for 44% of total recurring revenue, which is up 3%, and we expect this share to continue to
increase at this rate, as we discussed during Capital Markets Day. It also reflects that we are focused on executing our strategy to
expand the value of the 3DEXPERIENCE platform as a platform for innovation and business applying the subscription model.
In 2023, we saw this trend accelerating by increasing share of large 3DEXPERIENCE wins with broad-based adoption across geos
and industries as well as an acceleration of the transition to subscription at SOLIDWORKS.
Consequently, recurring revenue for full year now accounts for 80% of total software revenue, increasing the share of predictable
revenue from 78% last year. Upfront license revenue was up 2% for the year, highlighting that subscription transition is progressing
fast and there's a strong comparison base in 2022. Together, upfront license and subscription are up double digit, 11%, versus last
year, which is reflecting very solid organic growth. Services revenue was in line with the overall trend up 10% for the year.
Throughout 2023, we focus on improving our profitability, finishing strong with Q4 operating margin at 35.9%, up strong 160
basis points ex-FX year-over-year and on EPS of our -- of EUR 0.36, representing an increase of 40% year-over-year. As a result,
we delivered an operating margin of 32.4%, highlighting the disciplined resource management throughout the year which most
importantly, will continue to provide the flexibility for future investment. As for EPS, Pascal highlighted the 5-year plan achievement
earlier this morning, doubling EPS to EUR 1.20 compared to 2018.
Now let's review briefly how we performed relative to the objectives for 2023. Total revenue was in line with our guidance, slightly
below midpoint by EUR 3 million, excluding currency, which had an impact of EUR 10 million. The lower software revenue was
offset by a higher growth in services. Operating margin at 32.4% at the midpoint, excluding the impact from currency.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 01, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11More importantly, we continue to invest to support our strategic initiatives with a net headcount growth of 1,300 for the full year,
except the strong basis for continued margin improvement in the future. As mentioned earlier, EPS was EUR 1.20, which was also
driven by solid operating performance and strong financial income in Q4.
To summarize, the financial model of Dassault Systèmes is working and the transition to subscription and cloud is well underway and
is set to accelerate in line with our 5-year plan.
Now to the growth drivers. As highlighted, we are accelerating our path to subscription revenue growth, hence, which provides greater
visibility and resiliency. 3DEXPERIENCE revenue rose 21% in Q4 at constant currency. This marks a new all-time record with
3DEXPERIENCE at 42% of addressable software revenue. For the full year, 3DEXPERIENCE revenue grew 19%, representing a
share of 36% of addressable software revenue. Over 2/3 of the growth is driven by deals larger than EUR 3 million, highlighting the
strong value potential in our installed base.
Cloud revenue grew 12% in 2023. And as anticipated, while MEDIDATA growth contribution remained lower this quarter,
3DEXPERIENCE Cloud continued fast growth in Q4, building a run rate of reaching EUR 200 million. The growth in
3DEXPERIENCE Cloud reflects a strong contribution from new customer wins, and the cloud is now representing 24% of our full
year software revenue. We are confident that we will further capitalize on the momentum of these course drivers to continue to capture
market share in 2024 and beyond.
Now turning to cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash and cash equivalents totaled EUR 3,568 billion compared to EUR 2,769
billion at the end of 2022, which reflects an increase of EUR 799 million. At the end of the quarter, our net cash position totaled EUR
578 million, an increase of EUR 803 million versus net financial debt of EUR 227 million in December 31, 2022. It clearly highlights
the disciplined and efficient capital allocation we have in place and a strong path to deleverage since the acquisition of MEDIDATA.
Now let's look at what is driving our cash position at the end of the fourth quarter. We generated EUR 1,565 billion in operating cash
flow for the full year, an increase of 3% versus last year. The changes in operating working capital reflects growth in business and
timing of invoicing, which we will expect to catch up in 2024. The nonoperating working capital is slightly less favorable due to the
timing of cash tax payments and onetime cash tax effects. This will have a reverse positive effect in the next year.
To sum up, operating cash flow was mainly used for the cash dividend paid in Q2 of EUR 276 million. The net purchase of treasury
shares for a total of EUR 162 million and investment in CapEx of EUR 134 million and repayment of lease liabilities of EUR 89
million. Lastly, the FX impact was about EUR 68 million versus last year.
Now let's turn to our fiscal year 2024 objectives. For the full year 2024, we initiated our objectives with a growth rate of 8% to 10%
for both software revenue and total revenue. It reflects an acceleration of our subscription revenue growth at 17% to 19%. As you
see evidenced in our 2023 performance, the shift to subscription is broad-based and well aligned with our growth drivers of value up
leveraging the 3DEXPERIENCE platform and large transformation deal activity, evidenced in the second half 2023 momentum with
JLR, Ford and BMW and in our pipeline for 2024.
CENTRIC PLM is based on a powerful diversification and platform expansion strategy, which is set to continue a high double-digit
growth rate. And lastly, we are taking into account the temporary slower contribution from our Life Sciences business. Precisely,
we expect the software revenue contribution for MEDIDATA to be low single digit to flat before returning to double-digit growth in
2025.
Consequently, we will continue to take market share and expand the offering on virtualization of the entire drug life cycle, as
highlighted by the Biogen example or MGEN case in 2023. On this basis, we expect double-digit growth of our recurring revenue in
2024 in the range of 10% to 11%.
We expect our upfront license revenue to be in the range of minus 1% to plus 3%, and Services revenue growth is expected at 9%
to 10%, in line with business growth. We further expect the full year operating margin to be in the range of 32.5% to 32.8%, a year-
over-year improvement of 30 to 50 basis points ex-FX, reflecting the continued disciplined OpEx policy while investing to sustain
our future growth. Essentially, we are returning with the operating margin to the 2022 operating margin levels ex-FX. Considering the
above, we target our diluted EPS to grow 10% to 12% ex-FX in 2024.
And now for Q1, let me provide some additional insights which will help you to model the starting point of view. We target growth
at constant currency between 7% to 8%, assuming subscription cost of 14% to 15% and upfront license revenue between minus 3% to
plus 2% growth.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 01, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12In terms of profitability, we expect the operating margin to be in the range of 30.6% to 30.7%, improving marginally year-over-year,
and a double-digit growth of diluted EPS at EUR 0.29 to EUR 0.30. For additional information and to review what we've discussed, I

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 13Question and Answer
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
And we'll start with questions from the room.
Nicolas David
ODDO BHF Corporate & Markets, Research Division
The first one is on MEDIDATA. So if you were expecting that. I understand the explanation is what [indiscernible] what has changed
compared to the initial trajectory you were taking for Q4 [ 2050 ] expecting, software growth to be better than it was what it has been?
And I don't think you are expecting growth to be flattish in 2024. And it's a bit surprising to see MEDIDATA expected to grow slower
in '24 than it was in '23. So maybe could you come back on that?
And second question is regarding SOLIDWORKS. So pretty pleased to move to subscription, which I think is positive, but could you
give us some color about the timing of the inflection point we could see regarding this move when it shall -- that will be positive for
SOLIDWORKS growth? Is it somewhere in 2024 or '25 or beyond?
And could you also do -- could you give us some numbers regarding the underlying bookings and those elements? I know you monitor
all of that.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Thank you, Nicolas, for the question. And so on MEDIDATA, the most important part besides what I explained is we're winning
market share in an environment where the study volumes are in compression. And that's due to the COVID bubble that was created
during the years 2020 and 2021. In fact, the decline in study starts has accelerated in 2023. And now we have to absorb or digest this
volume decline in our 2024 revenue.
It started already in 2023, as you see in the numbers. But for 2023, to come back on the revenue growth achievement, we delivered
10% total revenue growth for the year versus a very strong comparison double digit. That's what we committed to do.
In Q4, we had very strong momentum in Services. We had the baseline that we saw for Q4 Software revenue, which gave us the
visibility to the double digit for full year, which we committed throughout the year.
Now as we condition from 2023 to 2024, what you typically do, it's a backlog-driven business, right? That's already forward. You
go through all the orders that you received until the order entry until the end of year-end 2023, you reconcile and the volume, the
compression in 2023, we saw very clearly evidence with the partners. And their reduction in volume orders for single study start, of
course, has an impact into 2024 revenue that is very hard to predict until they have closed out the year.
So we have been in 2023 in this environment, industrially speaking, our volume compression, COVID bubble that is coming down to
the normalized growth trend of what we have seen pre-pandemic. And now we are back on this trajectory, but we have the overhang
of the volume reduction from 2023, which impacts revenue in 2024 because there is a delay in revenue recognition between study
starts and the timing of revenue recognition.
And we will be through this environment in 2024 to be back to double-digit cost on our plan in 2025. So that's the visibility we have
today. Again, we are winning market share. We are setting up for growth in 2025, and it will be behind us in 2024.
Maybe one thing I should add also MEDIDATA is not the only thing we do in licensing. And more and more, the rest of what we do
is taking a share. We had a significant win with the traditional paradigm approach. For sure, in the med device, it has been the case for
a long time, but more and more in the pharma sector as well. And one of the domain, which is really having a lot of momentum right
now is everything which is related to the production with the bioreactors. I think we are clearly signing sizable deals.
So maybe it's adjustment for you, Rouven, is when we are reporting to Life Sciences, it's also important to highlight the rest of the
momentum because when we come together with MEDIDATA, the idea was to be able to do the drug development life cycle from
A to Z, not only to do a piece, which is the one which is linked more specifically to the clinical trial. And the rest is going extremely
well. That's the point.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 01, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 14Coming back to the question of SOLIDWORKS. I think you have the data. We told you it's almost reaching EUR 100 million. That's
what Rouven said, and it's growing triple digits. I think you know how to do the math. And why we are explicit with this is because
you remember, we say until it's material, we will not say too much. Now it's exceeding 10% of the total revenue of SOLIDWORKS. I
think it's becoming materials. And given the dynamics, it's important for you to have this visibility.
The second question is because that's the question I think behind, is it enough to offset the, let's say, the deceleration on the license
side. I think that's our bet of 2024, for sure. But one thing I can share with you, I was checking the pipeline compared to where we
used to be in -- at the beginning of the year in 2023. We are in a much better position related to the mainstream market, specifically for
SOLIDWORKS. We have more visibility. And we have, I think less volatilities coming from Asia, especially from China, right?
So if you do the sum, I think we are in a good position to deliver the growth, which is expecting and in line with the overall software
growth for the mainstream. Laurent?
Laurent Daure
Kepler Cheuvreux, Research Division
Laurent Daure, Kepler Cheuvreux. I have 3 questions. The first is on your BMW win. I was wondering, given the number of users,
this is almost as big as a GLR contract and especially the incremental revenue you will get on this one.
My second question is related to MEDIDATA. In the past -- last quarter, you were mentioning specifically the CROs to be the issue
and the big pharma to still be doing relatively okay. Based on your comments today, that it means that now it's the entire industry that
is software -- the CRO is even getting worse?
And my final question is there's been a little bit of swing on the free cash, lately. If we look at the next maybe 2 years, on average, do
we have any reason to believe that the free cash flow will trend differently from the EBITDA growth?
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
I'll take the first one. So coming back to BMW, I think it's a little bit different from JLR in a sense, if you remember, JLR, they
adopted 3DEXPERIENCE platform. I think it was in 2014. And when we renew our contract with them, we were expanding
significantly, not only on the usage of the platform, but also all the discipline on top of it.
Having said that, if I do -- if I give you an order of magnitude, it's a little bit less if you accumulate the numbers over the period of
time compared to GLR, but it's not so far. Why I'm saying this is because you could expect BMW to continue to buy on top of this.
The purpose of this contract is to migrate the V5 large install base we have into 3DEXPERIENCE platform and to get access to the
3DEXPERIENCE platform to all the different stakeholders, if you want. But on top of this, we will expand in simulation, we would
expand in manufacturing, we will expand also in the advanced life cycle management capabilities. And this is not yet reflected in the
contract. It's on top of.
Why so? Because BMW is buying in a different way than GLR. GLR, they wanted to have one single contract for all the different
things. And then BMW, they still want to size and to basically plan the different module deployments over the time. That's mainly.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
And coming to your second and third question, Laurent, absolutely, the impact is related to the CROs and the volume-related orders
that essentially the visibility the CROs have and their orders have been reduced because of the lack of visibility and number of clinical
trial starts.
So on the flip side, our business with our direct customer sponsors, the pharma industry at large continues to be strong and we renew
our subscription contracts above par. And there are several examples for that this year with strong renewals. So it's really related to the
volume and the CROs where this is coming from.
On the free cash flow, remember, we had, in 2023 -- coming from 2022 to 2023, a significant carryover from expenses of the hiring
of 2022. So the operating income of 2% gross operating income in absolute terms, non-IFRS growing at 2%. And that's what you see
reflected with the 3% operating cash flow and free cash flow growth. CapEx is fairly consistent, as you know. So we had to consume
here as well, the cycle of COVID, right, where the margin spike, then it came down because we had to catch up, and now we are back
to the normal trend. And that's what to be expected for operating cash flow.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 01, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15We expect operating income next year to grow at 10%, and so is the operating cash flow. And that should be the case for also the next
year.
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
If we don't have any more questions from the room, I suggest that we move to the call.
Operator
And the first question comes from the line of Mohammed Moawalla from Goldman Sachs.
Mohammed Essaji Moawalla
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
I had two. Firstly, on the Life Sciences, where clearly, you're taking a kind of more conservative view. Can you talk about perhaps
some underlying kind of assumptions driving these changes and your confidence on '25 in terms of bookings evolution? And how
should we think of the sort of the shape of that Life Science growth? I know you have flagged in the past that the comps are quite
tough still in the first half of the year. So you build to that kind of low to mid-single-digit growth. How should we think of that
trajectory, particularly in kind of Q1 and H1? Is there a possibility that on account of comps this growth could be kind of flat or down?
And then secondly, just in terms of some of these large 3DEXPERIENCE deals, thanks for the color on BMW, can you perhaps
comment on the kind of the state of some of the other deals in the pipeline, how that's evolving? And any kind of color on the kind of
shape and structure of some of these deals? And to what extent the closure of these deals is factored into your 2024 outlook?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
So maybe I'll start with the first question, Mo. Thank you on adding the question on the forward-looking view on the Life Sciences
business. You're right, the comps are tough in the first quarter for MEDIDATA and Life Sciences. We had strong growth in Q1. We
factored that into our Q1 objectives. But you're right, we project into 2024 from a booking standpoint, we actually expect double-digit
growth in bookings. And that will build the double-digit revenue growth in 2025.
Because remember, this is fully ratable revenue and bookings convert to revenue over time. And we have a strong pipeline --
supporting pipeline in Life Sciences at large, it's expanding outside MEDIDATA, as Pascal mentioned, but also for MEDIDATA
that gives us a good view of double-digit growth in bookings for Life Sciences in 2024, which gives us the confidence to be back to
double-digit growth in 2025 on revenue.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Related to this one question, let me step back a little bit and give you some flavor for the visibility on the pipeline we have for 2024.
Again, I was comparing the pipeline at the same time of the year, a year before. I think we -- in terms of profile, it's almost the same,
which basically mean the pipeline is backloaded. It's not unusual. You read that the pattern in the software industry and specifically
for us.
However, the opening pipeline is much better. I mean -- and the reason is, in fact, as part of the pipeline for 2024, you have exactly
what you say, we have a lot of transactions, which are follow-ups or the big deals we signed in the last 2 years on 3DEXPERIENCE
platform. So another way to see it, we have a significant traction which is coming from the expansion of the installed base.
If you had the fact that on the volume side, we have, I think, a better visibility compared to last year. I think we have a certain level of
confidence to achieve the goal we just shared with you.
Last comment is related to the weight between the license and the subscriptions, the split between the two. So I think on the large
deals, it's relatively easy to figure out because we are, to a certain extent, it's an 18-month, sometime 12-month discussion. So we
know if at the end, it will be subscriptions-driven or license-driven. And more and more, it's a mix, you know it.
For the volume, it's a little bit more difficult to predict because, for example, this year, we have been touched a little bit by surprise by
the acceleration of the subscription in the volume market.
So anyway, what I'm saying this is because if I look at the pipeline, we are very well covered for the subscriptions compared to the
objective we shared with you, and that's the reason why we have a certain confidence when we say the subscription will accelerate.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 01, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16And we say 16% in average in 2023, and we are going to 17% to 19%. So I think it's a real commitment on our side, but we have the
visibility for this.
However, it's a little bit more volatile on the license. And that's the reason why we are a little bit cautious for license and we say, let's
put a big range, which is flattish. Combined for upfront Life Sciences and subscription, 11% to 13% strong double-digit cost.
Operator
And the question comes from the line of Toby Ogg from JPMorgan.
Toby Ogg
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Maybe just firstly on the Q1 license guide. So minus 3 to 2, which does look low, particularly in the context of the minus 10% license
decline in Q1 last year. Could you perhaps just help us with any sort of conservatism versus other factors that you've built into the
guidance there to drive that?
And then just coming back again on the sort of MEDIDATA growth dynamics and how that sort of reconciles, I guess, with the 13%
to 15% Life Sciences and health care midterm targets. Could you -- yes, just give us a sense for kind of confidence levels around that
13% to 15%?
And how we should think about the phasing of the different pieces, I guess, all the way through to 2028? Because I guess if you have
lower MEDIDATA growth over the next couple of years, and that's going to imply a steeper acceleration in the sort of back half of the
period. So any thoughts on that would be great.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes. Toby, absolutely, I'll start with the last one directly. For the MEDIDATA growth, I think I was clear, the message is back to
double-digit growth in 2025. And we also expect that with the expansion beyond MEDIDATA into the broader Life Science and the
health market, we should be able to expand and build on top of that double-digit growth for MEDIDATA. So the message again is the
COVID bubble in 2024, which has to be fully digested before we are back to double-digit growth.
On Q1 guide, well, I think, in part, Pascal answered the question already before. But think of our pipeline is very strong to support our
full year guidance. But clearly, it favors H2 over H1. That's the message. That's why we are a bit more prudent on the first quarter.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Yes. Just to complement what you say, Rouven, I think the situation in China is much better. But if you look at the profile, you
remember last year, we were decreasing in China in H1. We're being at 6% growth in Q3 and 15%, 14% in Q4. But we still have
volatility. So that's the reason why we did not put in the guidance the 15% growth in China as well.
And as you may know, the license contribution coming from China is significant, in fact. So that's also a way to read our guidance for
the license for Q1.
Operator
And the next question comes from the line of Michael Briest from UBS.
Michael Briest
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
A sort of related question around cloud. The ambition for EUR 2 billion in revenues in 2025. From my estimation, you need to grow
25% for the next 2 years. Given what you're saying on MEDIDATA, I mean, is that a viable target still? And maybe looking out to
2028, how do you see perhaps the profile of cloud being different? Is there going to be a bigger contribution from the sort of Industrial
Innovation areas?
And then on price increases, inflation is beginning to moderate. Can you talk a bit about how prices are set to change in '24 over '23?
And how much of the growth comes from that?
Rouven BergmannDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 01, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 17CFO & Executive VP
Thank you, Michael. First, to the cloud. The message is simple, the EUR 2 billion target is achievable, and we are on track. 2025 is
what we said. Plus I gave a number of important elements of the cloud dynamic that we are having.
We see very strong acceleration outside of MEDIDATA for 3DEXPERIENCE Cloud in the mainstream market, but also in our
installed base. Remember, the flexible hybrid model that we introduced in Q3 is a new way to accelerate the adoption of cloud in our
installed base. It will come into full effect in 2024 and 2025.
I mentioned the 3DEXPERIENCE Cloud to be at a EUR 200 million run rate already. So it's more than -- it's about 20% of the total
3DEXPERIENCE software revenue and it's growing very fast. And if I put together the cloud business outside of MEDIDATA in
total, and I project 2 years out, we are on a line to be north of EUR 700 million. So now you add that together with MEDIDATA.
MEDIDATA back to double-digit growth in 2025, we are on track to the EUR 2 billion in 2025.
So that's -- these are the positive pieces, Michael, that are at play. You're right, the MEDIDATA slowdown has an impact on our
ability to achieve that. But we are more -- we are compensating that with the growth in cloud outside of MEDIDATA when the
dynamic is very positive.
The last point I would say is that we successfully are now qualified for -- to offer highest level of sovereign cloud standards with
Sovereign Cloud and FedRAMin the United States. And there's an increasing demand for sovereign cloud infrastructure. And that's an
area where we will be focusing on playing very diligently, which is another lack of growth in our business for cloud, for sure.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Can I add one thing, please? Because I remember, I was the one who set up this target, 1/3 of the revenue of the cloud in 2025. I did it
in 2020 when no one was expecting us to be at this level.
Why I'm saying this? Because at the end, it's only a point on the curve. The entire purpose for us, as you say, is to have the vast
majority of the revenue to be on the cloud at some point of time. There is only one thing we are not mastering is how fast our
customers they are migrating to the cloud. The problem is not the solution. We have them. The problem is not the infrastructure. As
you say, we know how to do hybrid model with sovereign and nonsovereign piece. The problem is not having the business model or
the contractual framework. It's done.
But however, you still have to figure out that it's something which is not fully dependent on Dassault Systèmes. Why I'm saying this
because every problem is giving the reinsurance that in 2025, we will be at the target. Won't care if it's in 2026, frankly speaking.
What is the difference? It will be a big problem, again, I'm telling you guys, we will not be able to have the vast majority of our
revenue on the cloud. That's not the point. So just keep this in mind because I remember very well when I set up this KPI, it was, at
that time, we had less than, if I remember well, 5% of the total revenue that was cloud-based. And I say...
I think there is a second question, Rouven, related to pricing.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes. On the pricing, of course, following COVID and the inflation, I think we did a very good job to protect us with price increases
that offset the cost -- rising cost infrastructure and inflation. We will continue to see that benefit in 2024.
As you know, price becomes effective over time as renewal cycles are catching up on the new prices. So we still expect a good portion
of that in 2024 as a carryover positive effect from the price increases in the last 2 years. Plus in 2024, we have implemented a price
increase but at a slightly lower level than in previous years.
So we continue to be focused on making sure that there's a parity of value between what we offer and the value that we are creating
with our customers and that we properly reflect that in our prices. So that's the issue.

And it comes from the line of Gianmarco Conti from Deutsche Bank.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 01, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 18Gianmarco Paolo Conti
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
I guess I can ask one, it would be probably if you could help us understand perhaps how does the guidance breakdown to the various
components such as Life Sciences, Innovation and Mainstream? I appreciate you've given color already on MEDIDATA, but it would
be good to also understand the other moving parts. And also, if you could give us some color on the software growth, excluding
MEDIDATA into 2024, that will be great.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
All right. Maybe I -- so the part was on key elements of Mainstream Innovation -- of Industrial Innovation in the mainstream sector
as far as I understood the question. So I think I referred to this. The big growth drivers in Mainstream -- in Industrial Innovation are
CATIA, growing double digit; SIMULIA, growing double digit; DELMIA manufacturing, growing strong double digit; and Data
Science net wise over 20% for the year. So these are the main drivers of growth.
As we see -- as we talked about during this call, a strong momentum of our customers shifting to the 3DEXPERIENCE platform and
expanding multi-domain. That's what's driving.
On Mainstream, we talked about the dynamics of SOLIDWORKS, which are very, very strong on subscription growth acceleration.
And of course, it has -- it's muting the growth on the license and the total revenue growth for SOLIDWORKS is mid-single digit.
While we see very strong growth for CENTRIC PLM, which is accelerating throughout 2023, and we expect good momentum for
2024.
So for the software revenue part, I think you asked one more clarity of software revenue for the Life Sciences sector. In our
disclosures for product line reporting, it is software revenue-related. So you have the software revenue numbers here. And the part that
we are adding to give you a bit more qualitative understanding of MEDIDATA's momentum is we have to look holistically as a total
revenue base for MEDIDATA because they are important incremental value-added services that are differentiating our offering for
which there is a high demand, and they are also high-margin. And they added 3 points, of course, on top of software to the 10%, of
course, at MEDIDATA.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
So can I add one thing?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
It's important for you to keep in mind that we are differentiating ourselves compared to our peers with this Services approach. The
vast majority of our previous, they provide the technology, the platform to collect the data for the clinical trials, but they do not do -- I
mean, they do not have the skills because they do not master, if you want the domain which is the clinical trial by itself.
So for certain companies, and you mentioned Moderna, we are the one running the clinical trial on behalf for them. And on top of
this, using our AI capabilities, the Gen AI capability, we extract the insight. So not only we have the domain, but we also have the
therapeutic expertise. And that's the reason why when Rouven is telling you it's a high value-added services, it's almost equivalent in
term of operating margin than the software.
And this is very differentiated in the market. Remember, the specificity of Dassault Systèmes is what? Is to master the technology to
associate it with the domain expertise and the industry know-how. That's how we are building our differentiation compared to many of
our peers. And this recipe is extremely relevant also in the Life Sciences.
So at the end, that's the reason why Rouven wanted to communicate on the fact that if you can look, the software piece, the
technological piece, but you should also look at the rest of what we do because at the end, the real footprint in this industry is by
combining the two. That's the point.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 01, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 4Presentation
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
Good morning, everyone. I'm Beatrix Martinez, Dassault Systèmes VP, Investor Relations. From the company, we have Pascal Daloz,
CEO; and Rouven Bergmann, CFO. Thank you for joining our First Quarter 2024 Conference Call with Pascal Daloz, Chief Executive
Officer; and Rouven Bergmann, Chief Financial Officer, here in London.
At the end of the presentation, we will take questions from participants in the room and on the call. Later today, we will also hold a
conference call. Dassault Systèmes results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. Most of the financial figures in this presentation are
presented on a non-IFRS basis with revenue growth rates in constant currencies, unless otherwise stated.
For an understanding of the differences between the IFRS and the non-IFRS, please see the reconciliation tables included in our press
release. Some of the comments we will make during today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements that could differ
materially from actual results. Please refer to today's press release and the Risk Factors section in our 2023 Document Universal,
published on March 18, 2024. I will now hand over to Pascal.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Thank you, Beatrix. Good morning, good afternoon to all of you. Always a pleasure to be physically here with you in London. So let's
start with the first quarter results.
So first of all, software revenue rose 7%, driven by 3DEXPERIENCE platform, up 29%. I think we delivered an operating margin of
31.1%, slightly over-performing our profitability objectives, thanks to the disciplined cost management, and Rouven will come back
on this. And as a result, our EPS was strong, up 12% at constant currency.
The takeaway is, in this first quarter, our 3DEXPERIENCE platform businesses, in fact, delivered very strong results. You have seen
it, [ plus 29% ], with a significant number of top industry leaders in the manufacturing on board on our platform. And I was speaking
with some of you just before, we are at the point where it was just before the COVID, where people now start to consider the platform
from end-to-end. And that's really -- it's really visible in everything we do in the manufacturing space.
Looking ahead, I think we have a strong 3DEXPERIENCE pipeline. In Life Sciences, we are definitively devoted to replicate our
success in other industry, provided this end-to-end platform. And this transformation lays, I think, the foundation for the sustainable
new source of growth. And on the short term, we believe and we anticipate MEDIDATA to be back to growth in the second half of
this year.
So therefore, if you combine all the good visibility we have on the pipeline with the 3DEXPERIENCE platform businesses, in
conjunction with the MEDIDATA outlook, we are confirming our guidance for the full year. Now let's move to some strategy and
vision updates.
We are stepping up in the generative economy, and it's our next step in our journey. And this generative economy goes far beyond
to really extend the virtual twin to the living organisms. It's about learning from life. It's about adopting a net positive way of living,
which is, you remember, it's -- we want to give the ability for the industry to give back to the planet and the society at least as much
as what they take to do the manufacturing, to do the trading, to do the usage of the products. We call it the eco-bill, the same way we
have the bill of materials in the past.
To do this, you need a much more holistic view of the entire life cycle because you need to measure at the end, the impacts you
are creating on the planet. And to give you certain examples, that's what we do in the transportation and mobility. It's not only the
passenger, it's not only the vehicles, but you have to take into consideration the building the city, the air qualities. And at the end, it's
an entire systems you have to represent.
It's also true for the Life Sciences. When we look at the concept, you know it's not only the body, but it's also the result of an organic
process. And the combination of the 2 is extremely difficult to master. So this is the reason why we came with this idea of the 3DS
universe. Because for us, the universe is really a way to combine different virtual twin together and connect the real and the virtual at
the same time.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL  APR 25, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 5It's very differentiating compared to many of our competitors. It's not fake. It's not a side. It's really a way to connect the 2 together.
And that's the reason why you have this V plus R. And by the way, universes mean how to unify the virtual and the real for the society
and the environment. That's what universe is about.
And you remember last quarter, I showcased an example for you, which was Biogen. Why Biogen was an interesting one because if
you remember, it's a leading American biotech company and specialize in the horological disease. And what they were doing, they
were connecting 2 virtual twins. One was the patient brace and the spinal columns, and the other one was the drug. And why so?
Because it was a way to determine the optimized way to inject the drugs for special patients. So this is really how we are creating the
connections between the 2.
Now moving forward, I think this holistic approach I was referring to is made possible because our 3DEXPERIENCE platform is also
a data science platform. And the way we express it, it's a way to connect the models from the science with the data coming from the
experiences, which is unique on the markets because none of our competitors can do the same at the same time. And we already have
an impressive use cases -- list of use cases.
For example, in our Space and Defense, they are using this ability to mix the 2 to improve the viability and the availability on the
critical assets. In consumer industry, people are using this approach to manage the churn, the cross-selling, the upselling, the pricing
management. In transportation and mobility, people are using this as a way to manage the situation of the supply chain, especially to
navigate in the raw material and energy component prices. It was also a way to make substantial savings on the procurement. It's also
a way to optimize the weight and balance, for example, on the product performance.
So there are many, many different cases where this combination is extremely relevant. And it's just the beginning, and we firmly
believe that the combinations between generative AI on one hand and the model and the science on the other hand is really
empowering the customer to nurture the circularity and elevating all the data into knowledge and know-how.
Now if I zoom and I basically return now to the business trend we observed in Q1. First, let's start with the manufacturing industry. I
already highlight the excellent performance we have our 3DEXPERIENCE platform and the process in terms of adoption within our
total base. Looking ahead, I think we have a strong pipeline in transportation and mobility in our Space and Defense, and I think this
has positioned us to secure major contract within the industry leader in 2024.
Now turning to Life Sciences & Healthcare. The sector is currently pivoting towards 3 things: patient centricity on 1 hand, technology
transfer from the lab to the bioreactors and the utilization of the generative AI to foster innovation on the research and the discovery
side. And I think MEDIDATA offers the most comprehensive platform to design, launch and conduct advanced clinical trials.
Why so? Because it's the only platform connecting the 3 parties, if you want, the pharma company on one hand, the hospital on the
other hand and the patients. And you need to connect those 3 at the same time. Many of the competition, they have a fragmented way
to address this market, at least they are using different platforms in order to make it happen.
In the Infrastructure & Cities sector, I think the decarbonization is becoming crucial, and it's contributing at least to -- why so, because
this sector is contributing to 1/3 of the global emissions. And sustainability is really driving the commitments on many things. One of
them is to triple the nuclear capacity to shift to clean energy and innovating in a much more inefficient way.
Among the challenges, I think we see reviving nuclear construction at scale and shorting the time between the nuclear constructions
and the commissioning. Now let's look at some win chart.
This quarter is about the win back. Let's start with the first one, Volvo. You remember, they are using CATIA for a long time, but they
were not using the rest, especially on the PDM systems. As you can see, they have decided to embrace the new generation of CATIA,
CATIA 3DEXPERIENCE, at the same time, and they are obviously deploying the 3DEXPERIENCE platform everywhere. And at the
end, the end result, they are migrating the 1,500 CATIA users to the next generation of CATIA.
Why they do this? Because they want again to transform from multiple platforms to one single one, which is scalable, which is
facilitating the real-time collaboration, which is helping them to reduce significantly the time to market. And this is basically the most
important things happening in this industry right now.
Why it's a difficult thing to do? Because you have to integrate the hardware and the software at the same time. And the gain, because
they have been able to measure the gain, it's not weeks, it's monthly. It's really a significant gap compared to the way they were doing
it previously.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL  APR 25, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 6The next point for them is really also to reduce their carbon footprint. And as you may know, we have invested a lot in life cycle
management capabilities to integrate these impacts on the sustainability and especially to predict how much carbon footprint you will
generate. And in this case, their target is reduced by 40%.
So I think it's just the beginning for the Volvo Car journey with 3DEXPERIENCE platform. And I think there are much more
expansion we can do specifically on system of systems, the [ most ] team -- to generalize the [ most ] team approach, but also the data
sciences.
Another win case, which I think will be interesting for you, is TSF. Why it's an interesting 1 because in this case, we have displaced
Veeva. So for the one, who are convinced that Veeva is disrupting us. I think we have the proof that it's not the case. This company is
a contract research organizations. They are based in Sweden.
And why they have selected Veeva -- sorry, MEDIDATA against Veeva. It's exactly for the reason I just mentioned before. Because
they want to have 1 single platform to address the different stakeholders. And as a CRO, if the system is already deployed in all the
hospitals where you are basically practicing the clinical trial, it's a huge advantage in time of cost.
So that's the reason why it was, I think, a wise choice for them. And the second thing is also they want to streamline at the same time
the clinical operation and the data management operations, which is something you cannot do if you have 2 different systems. And
[ REV ] is offering this ability to do both at the same time.
And last but not least, they are using MEDIDATA AI as a way to enhance the study enrollment and the feasibility. One of the
difficulty when you do a clinical trial is to identify the potential patient you have to enroll. And to do this, you need to assess the
different hospitals, the different sites in advance. And this ability we have within MEDIDATA with the AI capability to guide decision
process is pretty unique on the table.
So again, good case for you. The next customer win I selected is size well. You know it because we are in U.K. And as you know,
it's very important because it's a way to offer electricity and to decrease dependency on the fossil energy to 6 million household here
in U.K. So they have selected the 3DEXPERIENCE platform to several things. One is really to increase the nuclear capacity. More
importantly, is to enable nuclear constructions and reducing the time to operations. That's what is at stake.
And why it's a difficult thing, because on one hand, you have intensive engineering activities. And on the other hand, you have a lot
of construction activities. And the 2 needs to work extremely well together and not in sequence, in parallel. And this is the reason why
having 1 single virtual twin to aggregate the 2 view is fundamental for this sector.
So as a result, we are talking about 200 users. But in the next phase, we will expand to more than thousands of users because we need
again to connect all the different stakeholders in these projects.
Before to hand over to Rouven, let me do a quick wrap-up. I think we had a solid start of the year. Our 3DEXPERIENCE platform
business is delivering strong results and we have a strong pipeline going forward. In Life Sciences, the sector is pivoting, right? And I
think we are uniquely positioned to address those changes and more importantly, we are anticipating MEDIDATA return to growth in
the second half of the year.
And I think simultaneously, we are laying out the foundation for the future growth by leveraging the 3DEXPERIENCE platform,
enabling our clients to connect, on one hand, the data from experiences. And on the other hand, the model with from science. And they
are using the generative AI to nurture the circularity and to elevate the data in what we call the knowledge and the know-how. I think
now let's look at the Q1 performance and the outlook for Q2 2024. So Rouven, you have the floor.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Thank you, Pascal. So thank you, Pascal, and also welcome from my side for those who are here with us today and those who follow
us on the webcast.
As you heard, we are entering into the year with a solid start as we remain focused on our fundamentals and the fundamentals of our
business model. The combination of subscription revenue and upfront license revenue together grew 9% while the operating margin
was up 50 basis points to 31.1% and EPS grew by 12% ex-FX. We knew that coming into this year, that MEDIDATA would weigh on
our subscription performance. And in this context, subscription revenue is up 10% in the quarter.
If we exclude MEDIDATA, subscription revenue was up 22% and is driven by the strong growth in 3DEXPERIENCE. The share
of recurring revenue remains high at 84%. Upfront license revenue was strong in the quarter. It is up 7%, driven in part by goodDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL  APR 25, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7performance of our business in Asia and as well a stronger demand for CapEx investments supporting our customers' business model
preferences.
Now adding to the fundamentals, we generated EUR 671 million in operating cash flow. While below last year's level, cash flow
conversion remains healthy at 1.44x of non-IFRS operating income. This trend reflects the progressive shift to subscription as we see a
more ratable cash generation going forward.
Now let's review briefly how we performed relative to our objectives in Q1 2024. Total revenue at EUR 1.5 billion, it was in line with
our objectives, just below the midpoint, while lower software and service revenue were partially offset by currency. Operating margin
was at 31.1%, as said, above the high end of the objectives driven by disciplined expense management.
Importantly, we continue to invest to support our strategic initiatives with the net headcount growth of around 1,200 over the last 12
months. This sets a strong basis for continued growth and margin expansion in the future. As mentioned earlier, EPS at EUR 0.30 is
reflecting good operating performance and strong financial income in Q1.
So to summarize the financial results. In the context of the MEDIDATA transformation, we delivered solid financials in the first
quarter. Lower contribution in subscription revenue was offset by stronger upfront license. Clearly, 2024 is a back-end loaded year
like 2023, underpinned by continued momentum in 3DEXPERIENCE and the return to growth for MEDIDATA.
Profitability is strong as a result of effective cost control, while we continue to make focused investments to shape our strategic cost
drivers of 3DEXPERIENCE and cloud to support our full year and midterm objectives.
Now to our growth drivers. 3DEXPERIENCE revenue rose 29% in Q1 at constant currencies, driving the share of 3DEXPERIENCE
to 36% of addressable software revenue. And in this quarter, 3/4 of the growth related to 3DEXPERIENCE is driven by deals larger
than EUR 2 million, highlighting the strong value of potential and the momentum in our customer base.
In Q1, we had several key customers expanding the 3DEXPERIENCE platform use, such as Volvo, Honda, Dana, Payment
Shipyards, B. Brown and EDF. Cloud revenue grew 6% in Q1 due to the anticipated lower growth contribution of MEDIDATA. Ex-
MEDIDATA, cloud revenue was up around 50%, driven by continued growth momentum in 3DEXPERIENCE Cloud.
The cloud is now representing 24% of our Q1 software revenue. Key customers expanding on 3DEXPERIENCE cloud use in the
quarter were Renault, Bouygues Construction, Schindler, Honda, Dassault Aviation as well as Sanofi, besides many others. We are
confident that we will continue to capitalize on the momentum of our growth drivers and continue to grow our market share in 2024.
Now let me highlight to you the performance across GEOs as well as product lines, starting with the GEOs. Americas was up 5%, due
to lower anticipated due to the lower, but anticipated contribution from MEDIDATA this quarter. Excluding MEDIDATA, Americas
is up 9%, driven by strong momentum in Home & Lifestyle, Aerospace & Defense and durable growth in Transportation & Mobility.
Europe was up 7% with strong double-digit growth in the North and Western regions. We saw a well-diversified growth profile across
multiple industries such as T&M, Energy & Materials, Construction, as well as Home & Lifestyle.
Asia had a rebound in Q1, led by strong growth in China, up 17%, driving the strong license performance this quarter. Also Japan,
India and Korea delivered high single-digit software revenue cost. Now from a product line standpoint, we saw continued good
momentum in industrial Innovation, up 9% overall.
CATIA and ENOVIA were up high single digit. While DELMIA, NETVIBES were up double digit in software revenue. Subscription
revenue already represents more than 2x the license revenue in industrial innovation and was growing 20% in Q1. Life Sciences was
down by 2% overall with MEDIDATA at minus 3% versus a strong comparison base in Q1 last year. On the other hand, BIOVIA
had a good quarter, delivering high single-digit growth in software, driven by renewals and expansions with major customers such as
Regeneron, Gilead and Takeda.
Now let me provide you with an update on the market trends in clinical trials and our progress since the beginning of the year. First,
on a trailing 12 months basis, we see market growth trends normalizing. In fact, since the beginning of the year, over the last 3
months, study starts are stabilizing to be slightly up versus a decline of minus 10% at this time last year.
Second, in this improving market environment, our growth bookings in Q1 support our plan to return to growth in H2. In fact, our
study based bookings are back to growth driven by an increase in partner consumption. In addition, we have started to see increasing
activity in the midsized pharma segment, which has always been a catalyst of our growth.
Lastly and important to highlight, we are competing well with run rates up across all the segments, driving market share gains,
specifically in Phase III trials. To summarize, our market share dynamics are positive, adding about 2 points versus last year.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL  APR 25, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8On mainstream innovation, we see good performance with 10% growth, driven by an excellent performance of Centric PLM. In this
quarter, we won with Abercrombie and Fitch our largest deal in the fashion and apparel business. This, plus strong renewals, delivered
excellent performance. For SOLIDWORKS, we are clearly transitioning to subscription at scale. Subscription revenue is growing over
60%, offsetting the decline in license revenue. And more importantly, we expect this trend to continue and further accelerate towards a
higher share of subscription revenue to continue to drive sustainable growth.
As I just mentioned, a key contributor of our growth in industrial systems is provided by Centric PLM, which continues its strong
growth trajectory with signing of new large enterprise deals quarter-over-quarter, adding new logos to our growing list of brands.
In addition, we are successfully renewing with existing customers, expanding our share of wallet, which was demonstrated with
a number of strong renewals this quarter. So as you can see, the momentum is broad-based. Centric today delivers an integrated
platform from concept-to-customer, leveraging generative AI as a competitive differentiator. This is truly a new category of PLM, and
we are confident in building our path to $1 billion-plus business. Now let's turn to cash flow and balance sheet IFRS items.
Cash and cash equivalents totaled EUR 4.096 billion compared to EUR 3.568 billion at the end of 2023. This represents an increase
of EUR 528 million. At the end of the quarter, our net cash position totaled EUR 1.103 billion, an increase of EUR 526 million versus
net cash of EUR 578 million on December 31, 2023. This clearly highlights the disciplined and efficient capital allocation policy.
Now let's look at what's driving our cash position at the end of the first quarter. We generated EUR 671 million in operating cash
flow for the quarter versus EUR 783 million last year. Cash flow from operations was mainly impacted by a lower decrease in trade
accounts receivables this quarter versus last year. And this can be explained by 2 main effects.
First, there's an impact of over EUR 65 million of receivables was shifted to April as customers push payment dates to after the bank
holidays at the end of the quarter. Almost all of them have been collected to date. Secondly, receivables are trending above last year's
level due to the progressive adoption of subscription contracts in which invoicing is spread over the contract term and creates a new
pattern and the cash collected when compared to the upfront license model.
In 2024, given the dynamics highlighted above, Q1 represents about 38% to 40% of the expected full year operating cash flow. While
in previous years, Q1 averaged about 45% in the first quarter, 45% of the full year. As such, we expect a positive catch-up effect
already in Q2. For any additional information, you will find the operating cash flow reconciliation in our presentation published this
morning.
So to sum up, operating cash flow was mainly used for the repurchase of treasury shares of EUR 131 million, investments in CapEx
of EUR 57 million and repayment of lease liabilities of EUR 24 million. Lastly, the total FX impact was about EUR 33 million versus
December 31 last year. Now let's turn to the objectives for 2024.
Most important, we confirm our full year objectives. Total revenue growth of 8% to 10%, operating margin of 32.5% to 32.8% and
the EPS at EUR 1.29 to EUR 1.31. Our pipeline supports our growth objectives as it's broad-based across multiple levels as mentioned
with a more back-end loaded shape. We have good visibility in the continued momentum of 3DEXPERIENCE growth contribution,
including sizable transactions.
MEDIDATA is on track to return to growth in H2 based on stabilizing market environment of clinical trial staff and continued good
execution as evidenced in win rates and market share gains. As mentioned as well, SOLIDWORKS is progressing well, transitioning
to the subscription model as planned. So as mentioned, we are reaffirming our full year objectives, which also includes double-digit
growth in recurring revenue in the range of 10% to 11%, upfront license revenue in the range of 2% to 5% growth and services growth
expected at 8% to 9%.
Now to update your models, I would also like to share some additional information related to Q2. We expect total revenue and
software revenue in Q2 to grow between 7% to 9% each with upfront license revenue in the range of minus 1% to plus 7%, recurring
revenue up 9% and subscription revenue up 15% to 16%.
Services revenue is expected to grow 6% to 7%. Our profitability is expected to continue to expand with operating margin up 50 basis
points at the midpoint ex-FX, reflecting an operating -- reflecting a reported range of 31.3% to 31.5%.
EPS is expected to be in the range of EUR 0.30 to EUR 0.31 and up 10% to 12%. Now let me conclude. We had a solid start to the
year. Our core business is performing well and is expected to accelerate throughout the year.
2024 is a back-end loaded year underpinned by continued momentum in 3DEXPERIENCE. For MEDIDATA, we see progress
towards recovery in the second half, supported by the stabilization of the clinical trial market and good execution in terms of booking

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10Question and Answer
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
Yes, we'll start with questions from the room.
Frederic Emile Alfred Boulan
BofA Securities, Research Division
It's Fred Boulan, Bank of America. I have 2. One is on China, a very good quarter. If you can spend a bit of time on the outlook there,
what you're seeing for the rest of the year in the macro outlook that remains a bit complex.
And then coming back to MEDIDATA Q1. If you -- can you share with us, like you did in the previous quarter, the delta between
what you're seeing on the software side versus services. And when you look at the expectation of growth going forward, I mean, you
mentioned return to growth in the second half of the year. Again, if you can be a bit more specific on the software component versus
the rest of the business, that would be very helpful.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Rouven, you want to?
Well, I can start with China, and you will follow-up. So I think China, you have seen 17% growth, more than 20% for the license.
Remember, China is really a license-driven market more than a subscription one.
On one hand, you could argue that compared to last year Q1, it's an easy comp, which is true. But on the other hand, I think given
the uncertainty we have, I think we are relatively pleased with the momentum we are seeing. The growth is coming from multiple
industries.
Obviously, the auto sector is extremely dynamic for us. And as you may know, we have a large footprint with all the EV makers in
China. Construction is also driving this growth and aerospace as well. And more and more, we see also the recovery on the industrial
equipment. And the proof of this is really the good dynamic we have with the mainstream market.
China is a significant market for SOLIDWORKS, and we had good bookings in Q1. Now if I look at the rest of the year, the pipeline
is better compared to what it used to be. And there is 1 simple reason for that. China is investing a lot in innovations. And the
geopolitical environment, to a certain extent, is forcing them to eliminate certain dependency. And there, I mean, the government
is investing in many, many different sectors in order to accelerate the innovation cycle, and we are benefiting indirectly from this
investment cycle. Rouven, few words about MEDIDATA?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes, absolutely. So MEDIDATA software revenue was very much in line with services. Also keeping in mind, Q1 last year was a very
strong quarter for both software and services. More importantly, we're building our backlog for software and services costs.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
I think they had 2 questions. The mix between service and software?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
No change. No change. It's fairly aligned, right, between the 2%. They were down about minus 2.5%, amounting to minus 3%, to be
super precise. So it's the same it's 2% for services and software. It's very fairly aligned this quarter.
I know. It's not the case in Q1. It's not the case in Q1, and we are really focused on building the backlog for the growth in the back half
of the year and next year. And services bookings have been also good, yes, but they will produce revenue in out quarters.
Charles Brennan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division
It's Charlie Brennan here from Jefferies. I'll do 2 questions, if I can. Firstly, it sounds like you anticipated the metadata weakness at the
start of the year. So can you just highlight where the disappointment came in the recurring line of the business?
And then secondly, it's been a while, I think, since I've seen a software company beat license expectations. Can you just give us
some sense of what products contribute to the license line these days. And you've obviously got some of those that are already in the
terminal decline cycle like SOLIDWORKS that's switching to subscription. So just at a high level, can you talk through which ones
are growing and which ones are declining. And then just as a final follow-up, can you give us a proportion of the upfront subscription
that fell into the license line .
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Okay. So what drove the mix this quarter? We give the choice to customers to purchase in the subscription, the OpEx model and
the CapEx model. And so as a result of that, the mix of deals can vary from quarter-to-quarter. And we are giving -- trying to give a
precise outlook quarter-to-quarter, but there can be some fluctuation.
So in this quarter, specifically, we had very strong performance in China, which is predominantly a perpetual license business. The
license revenue in China is up more than 20%, and it contributes to the license cost over proportionately. We also had a couple of
larger transactions that were recognized as upfront license and not subscription this quarter. And that's an important point to highlight
because on the subscription side, we report only what subscription, what is recurring year-over-year.
And if something is not recurring year-over-year or multiyear, 2 years more, it's represented in the upfront license part, which you see
contributing to the strong upfront license revenue this quarter.
So to summarize the question, there can be fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter. Subscription revenue growth for MEDIDATA also
was a bit at the lower end of our expectations, while we are focusing on building the cost for [ H2 ] with bookings driving the backlog.
And if you exclude MEDIDATA, subscription was 22%. The last point I would like to make, and it addresses your third question.
If we look at the subscription revenue run rate over the last 12 months ex-MEDIDATA, it's growing 29% and it's up 2 points year-
over-year at the exit of Q4 last year. So while the subscription number at the surface looks soft, the dynamics in our subscription
momentum ex-MEDIDATA is positive, remains to be positive.
And as we are getting through the cycle of MEDIDATA on the other side, we will see also the rebound in subscription. And for Q2,
we have a number of large transactions in our pipeline that will benefit the subscription revenue as what we expect. So we will see a
progressive increase in subscription revenue reported Q2 over Q1. And maybe to the products, Pascal? Do you have anything specific
we can say?
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
No. But I think there is no specific trends toward the product line. It's much more the way we structure the deal as Rouven was stating.
And when you have the multiyear, I think it's a good practice, and it's much more reliable for you to have the nonrecurring parts
so-called subscription anyway to be in the license more than in the subscription line because by ensuring this, we are sure that the
volatility is only on 1 item, right, not on the other one.
Charles Brennan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division
So what proportion of the license is an upfront subscription?DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL  APR 25, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
We don't disclose that on a quarter-to-quarter basis. There are 12-month subscription deals, so 1-year subscription deals that are
recognized in the quarter for the license part, while the support is ongoing. But I don't think that there's any value in carving that out to
give you this number.
I think it's more important to look over the trend, which is up 2 points year-over-year ex-MEDIDATA, which demonstrates the
momentum we are creating and showing that there's a strong progression. There's is no volatility in the number. The volatility is in the
license upfront.
Balajee Tirupati
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research
Balajee from Citi. 3 questions from my side. Firstly, on MEDIDATA. Why you expect to return back to growth in the second half of
the year? Will it be fair to say that the full year -- on a full year basis, are you still expecting growth for the business?
Then 2 quick questions on capital allocation. Firstly, on cash flow. Your days of receivable increased by 12 days on a year-over-year
basis. While multiyear subscription contract potentially is contributing to that, did you also extend easier receivable terms to some of
the -- in some of the larger contracts, which has contributed to this?
And the second part of capital allocation on M&A. M&A is part of your midterm target. But over the last 4-plus quarters, since you
have deleveraged your balance sheet, you have not seen any meaningful announcement. So where are the bottlenecks? And how is the
pipeline looking right now?
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
You take the first 2. And I think, we don't refer to the last 1.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
I'm happy to take the first 2. The trajectory for MEDIDATA is the H1, H2 story. And we are right now focused on building the growth
for the second half of the year. Q1, we had a tough comp. We saw some bookings improvement, as I highlighted in my prepared
remarks, which certainly for the partners and the partner consumption, which means the sell-through through the contract research
organization is trending positive for the first time in 3 quarters, which is a really positive signal. And that will return back to growth
over the next quarters.
Now for Q2, I want to be prudent as we are focused on building H2 and for the full year, we expect flat, to be flat. Maybe we can
be slightly up. But for now, my based on assumption is to be flattish. And that will be -- we will be then, for the second half of
the year, build the ramp for double-digit growth in 2025. That's the trajectory which we are on. And I think so far, our -- from our
differentiation from what we hear from our customers, plus the momentum we are seeing also in midsized pharma companies, that has
always been a catalyst of our growth. I think there's good signs that give us the confidence that we are on the right track.
And of course, we will update you as you will ask us during the next quarters for sure. But I think we have good visibility on our path,
on our trajectory. For the DSOs. So you're right, the DSOs, they have increased year-over-year. However, they are stable sequentially
or slightly down sequentially. There are 2 main reasons for the increase on year-over-year. The first 1 is the timing of single large
contracts such as JLR and Renault, for which we expect an improvement in Q2.
And the second piece is the overdue payments, which contributed 8 days to the DSO increase, of which 4 days are related to the
payments that slipped from March to April. So that will already improve. That has already been reversed. So there was kind of a bump
in the number in Q1, Q2, the slippage at the last days of March to April because of the unfavorable calendar year that we could not
avoid.
So in summary, I expect the DSO in Q2 to improve to be below what we saw in Q1, and that's what's happening. I think there are
distinct effects. We have not provided more favorable financing terms to customers. We can be and have to be, if we have very large
transactions, we have to work with our customers as they are making large commitments with us. We are working with them in
partnership. And that's why I highlight JLR and Renault as 2 such examples. But they are paying customer. There's no issue with any
of those contracts. In fact, in Q2, we have a large invoice and we will have large receivables from those clients.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL  APR 25, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 13Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Highlighting to the M&A, you're right. I mean, it's part of the model, and it's also factor in a way in the long-term plan we shared with
you last year. We have a pipeline. The good news is we have a pipeline. We are working on it. However, I think we have something
which is could characterize the way we do it. We are extremely disciplined in terms of value creation.
And if you look at the recent transaction in our space, many of them have been done on a very high multiple. And I think remember,
the software, every 10 years, you have to bet again. So if you are not capable to have the payback in less than a decade, I think it's
probably a questionable from a value creation standpoint. So that's my way to answer to your question.
So really, we are working on it. pipeline is there, but we want to do it in our own standards in a way to ensure we will continue to
deliver the value to the shareholders. And also the M&A is not too much for -- I mean, usually, when we acquire a company, it's not
for what they do. It's what we want to do together. And the together is sometimes more important than what they do. So it's taking
time with some of the folks. So -- but I'm pretty confident that it's moving forward the way we want.
Michael Briest
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Michael Briest at UBS. Just a quick clarification on MEDIDATA, Rouven. Is that double-digit growth for fiscal '25 or in fiscal '25?
And then just on SOLIDWORKS, I mean, you gave an interesting data point on the Q4 call around, I think, EUR 200 million exit rate
in subscription. Can you maybe just talk a bit about the transformation there of how much of the business is still licenses, how much is
cloud as opposed to sort of what 3D works as opposed to just on-premise subscription and just the trajectory?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Thank you, Michael, for your questions. And I clarify the first one. I think the articulation of our explanation, where we are on the
recovery and transformation of MEDIDATA is going well. We are creating an exit run rate in 2024, where we are back to growth, and
we will continue to build that exit run rate through our 2025 to be a double-digit cost. So I'm really looking for building the backlog
growth at 10-plus percent to support 10-plus percent revenue growth. That is going to be our objective to be there in 2025.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Related to SOLIDWORKS, I think the statistic I have in mind is this quarter, if I look at the number of units, which is a good way to
assess the balance between the upfront license and subscriptions, in which 2/3 is license and 1/3 is subscription. I think it was less than
20% last year on license around 10% in subscription.
And for the cloud, I don't have the number in mind. But it goes with it, I mean.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
On the cloud, maybe I can clarify. The cloud is fairly GEO-specific as well, interestingly. We have good momentum in the Americas.
But we also -- we have in Euro North and in Euro West, the cloud in terms of number of seats is over 40% of the total seats sold. So
there are GEOs where we are progressing extremely fast on our cloud business, while others will take a little bit more time. But it's
working.
But remember, we took a decision. It's for -- to have the platform being -- the connection to the platform being mandatory for
SOLIDWORKS. So -- and the platform is already -- will be on the cloud for the mainstream market. So the momentum is really in
time, we are building the momentums to have the cloud proportion accelerating in the SOLIDWORKS base in the coming quarters. I
think we are relatively pleased by the shift.
Mohammed Essaji Moawalla
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
Two questions. Firstly, as you start to drive some of these larger standardization deals, this is obviously going to have an impact
around kind of the cash flow dynamics of the business and create that sort of volatility. So to the extent that you can just help us kind
of parse some of these different moving parts because there's obviously the component of license with delayed invoicing.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL  APR 25, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 14You also talked about as you build subscription and move to more quarter -- quarterly invoicing. Help us understand that should we
assume that when you sign one of these big deals, in the subsequent few quarters, expect kind of weakness in that sort of free cash
flow temporarily even if it just the case? And I don't know if there's a way to kind of list some of these moving parts in the free cash
flow in order of magnitude just so we have a kind of framework of how to think about this impact.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Thank you, Mo. I think, Rouven, this question is for you. You have a fantastic opportunity to clarify because there are many, many
misunderstandings, let's say, this way, which we are clear?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes. Now we are clear. I think we had also the opportunity to address this topic in some of the previous questions. But I think
specifically for the large deals, we have in large deals an upfront component and a recurring component. And the upfront component
is reported as part of the upfront license, and only what is recurring is supported in the subscription.
Some of our large transactions, like the one that we talked about last year with Jaguar Land Rover, also had a cloud component, which
is a purely ratable component, which you recognize quarter-to-quarter. But the parts that are upfront on a multiyear contract, they are
reported in the upfront license, and so they are not creating volatility in the subscription. That's again why I was going back to the 12-
month subscription run rate to illustrate to you that the run rate is increasing outside of MEDIDATA despite some of the perceived
volatility, but the run rate is consistent and is increasing.
So from a cash standpoint, those large deals, you're right, they can have some level of volatility as those are ramping and customers
need some level of financing at the early phase of the transaction. It can be in the first year or second year until the revenue
recognition and invoicing and collections is harmonized. So we expect to be at that level of harmonization in 2025 with the 2 large
deals that we signed in previous years being Renault as well as JLR.
So I think that volatility at this point is temporary as a result of these large transactions, as it relates to cash flow. But when we look
at the combined 12 months, there is -- the volatility is small. I mentioned Q1, which we had an elevated DSO, as I explained, which
was in part the result of some deferred invoicing schedule related to JLR, which will reverse in Q2. And that has created some of the
unbilled receivables that we report, which are up year-over-year. But as we are consuming this year and invoicing them, they will start
to normalize.
Mohammed Essaji Moawalla
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
And then secondly, in terms of sort of the overall pipeline makeup in build, particularly on the kind of core manufacturing business.
I think you've highlighted that there's sort of more of these [ time ] there's additional contracts to come. I know each one is kind of
varied. Some of them are kind of upgrades to 3DEXPERIENCE and the full platform. Some are kind of V5 to V6.
Where is the kind of the, as you look at that pipeline, and I know every customer is different, but can you give us a flavor of the
evolution of that product pipeline? Is it still very auto-centric? Or should we see some of these generalization contracts in other
verticals as well? Because obviously, this is key to kind of underpinning that medium-term visibility you have on the -- particularly
the top-line growth?
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Okay. So there are a few questions within your question, Mo. The pipeline is, I mean, is structured around 3 things. One is, as you
said, certain customers who have adopted the 3DEXPERIENCE platform expanding their footprint. And in the car industry, I will say
it's probably representing more than, I mean, close to 40%, right?
Then we have some win-backs in the car industry, where I was mentioning Volvo. But I hope this year, this will not be the only
one. And we have larger win-back in the pipeline, whatever it's in the auto sector, but also in the aerospace supply chain. And this is
probably something like 15% of the pipeline in value, right?
And the rest is coming from the diversifications, and we see more and more traction in consumer goods and consumer packaged
goods. You remember the time when we had P&G almost the only reference we have that in this space. It's not anymore of a case.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL  APR 25, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15And it's not only coming from Centric PLM, which is giving us a huge footprint in this space, but also the combination with the rest of
what we do. For example, the reformulation in the CPG industry is driving a lot of new PLM needs, and we are very well positioned,
in fact, for this. Architecture and construction, believe it or not, but the platform is more and more used to do the data science part.
As an example, as I'm seeing, L&T is a good case. It's also in the infrastructure space, you have seen with my reference, the energy
transition is going also to change the way we produce the energies, the way we distribute the energy, and the platform is really
considered now being, I will not say at least a standard in the nuclear activities, but more and more considered also for the distribution
network.
You remember, I was highlighting the [ hydroelectric ] case, which is the Spanish electricity distributor, but they are not the only
one considering the platform right now. So I think it's helping to balance the different opportunity across multiple industries, having
different investment cycle in fact. That's the reason why I think, if you do the mix between the expansion between the win-backs,
between the diversification and the momentum we have in the diversification, we are very confident for the pipeline for the year.
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
I can just take some questions from the webcast. May I ask you to ask just 1 question so that we have time for everyone.
Operator
Now we're going to take our first question, and it comes from the line of Daure Lauren from Kepler Cheuvreux.
Laurent Daure
Kepler Cheuvreux, Research Division
I have 3 questions. The first 1 is going back to Life Science. I understand your comment and your cautiousness on the second quarter.
But should I read that the trough is in Q1 or in Q2 given the easier comps in the second quarter?
My second question is on MEDIDATA, on the large pharma? On your historic clients, when you look at the new trials that they are
launching, let's say, over the last 6 or 9 months, do you still have a very strong retention? Or have you seen on the specific clients
some of them switching to competitors to be clear.
And my final question is a clarification on the cash flow. Given the comments you made on the first quarter, have you changed your
view on a few full year outlook? Or are you still eyeing for the same momentum in operating and free cash flow?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Okay. Thanks, Laurent. Thanks for your questions. On the first one regarding the second quarter. As I said, I think the second quarter
outlook is in a similar range than the first quarter results, as we are focused on building our growth for H2 to be flat next -- for this
year. So we're really focused on building our backlog back to growth to support double-digit growth.
And for Q2, we continue to win market share, as I said, in the first quarter and the win rates are very good, and we will continue
to execute in this market to expand our footprint and our relationships. The other thing that Pascal mentioned the importance is of
the differentiation of new products that we brought to the market where we are focused on with our customers to adopt those new
products that are differentiating us and are driving future growth.
And then to the pharma, to the large pharma. For the new trials, I think it's -- we are very much in line with the market trend. Our
existing subscription customers continue to start new trials with us on our platform. They have long-term subscription contracts. And
we are confident about expanding those contracts with us as we go in through renewal phases. So there's no indication other than that.
And we are, of course, focused not only to renew what we have. We want to grow on top of that. On the cash flow, the answer is
simple. There is a pending impact, and there is no change for the full year.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Maybe I can add 1 thing for you, Laurent. It's a statistic I was looking carefully. It's how much new clinical studies we are starting
quarter-after-quarter. And I was comparing Q1 last year with Q1 this year, and it's 1,000 more. So it's significant. It's probably more
than many of the competitors we have. But it's giving you an early sign about how the market is back against to the normal growth.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL  APR 25, 2024

Pascal Daloz

The top 20 pharma. Look, we are working with almost all of them. We had -- at the mitigator time, we used to have a famous list
of those who were with [ Oracle ]. But from those customers that on the top pharma we used to have, we continue to have the same
number of clients, top pharma customers, where there could be some changes in the deployment and mix of what we do with them.
But if your question goes in direction of have you lost any footprint with your existing customers, the answer is no.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Now we're going to take our next question. And the question comes from the line of Nicolas David from
ODDO BHF.
Nicolas David
ODDO BHF Corporate & Markets, Research Division
My question relates to the mix between license and subscription in Q1 and Q2. So you explained well how you classify the upfront
part of subscription. But nevertheless, you had some volatility in other software subscription. Could you explain deeper what will
drive this nice acceleration you expect in Q2? And I think it's like a more than 10-point acceleration you expect in -- over the software
subscription in Q2?
And at the same time also, you increased your annual guidance for license. So what prompted you to do that? And should we think
that also expect better support to growth?
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Yes. Thank you, Nicolas, for the follow-up. On the mix, I think for now looking at Q2, we have a good pipeline, which is really
geared towards subscription. And the Q2, that's where we have very good visibility. MEDIDATA, as I said, will continue to be in the
same range. And so it's really coming from our core business, the acceleration.
And related to the license increase in our guidance for the full year is simply a reflection of the first quarter. Now we made some
adjustments reflecting first quarter results. But you also saw that in the Q2 guide, the volatility really is in the license range of minus
1% to plus 7%. That's what's a bit difficult to preempt, right? That's why we wanted to be -- have the more flexibility.

And compared to Q1, you think that you have a better visibility regarding the subscription, extreme data that you have?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 17I just have 1. Sorry to come back on this again. I want to be very specific here. And I was hoping you can share some more detail
again on the visibility in MEDIDATA to get back to growth in H2 and double-digit into 2025. I'm wondering if you could share
some detail on whether the visibility is driven by several conversations you had with CROs that are giving you confidence in the
guidance? Or just trying to understand the underlying assumptions like here, if it's more macro driven in the form of inputs from these
conversations? Or are there particular large deals in the pipeline that you see progressing further to conversion?
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Absolutely. Thank you for your persistence and reiteration so it gives me an opportunity to make it even clearer. So you're right, there
are several factors. But there's a macro factor, where we see evidence that from a market standpoint, the number of clinical trials start
to become much more predictable and be back to the normal cost trend that what we saw pre-COVID, and we see the evidence in the
first quarter. That was in part of my prepared remarks. So that's 1 factor. That's a stabilizing factor.
The second factor you mentioned is the visibility with CROs, where for, yes, more than 9 months for the first time, we saw an increase
in partner consumption. So the throughput, the sell-through through the CRO partner being up versus the previous 3 quarters, where
CRO partners were in terms of their volume shrinking and now they are stable to growth. So we see growth through our channel,
which we are essentially in a new upswing cycle with our partners, which is also, by the way, a sign that we are not losing to the
competition.
We are continuing to take market share and our partners continue to commit to -- with us. And then there's a third element besides
the partners, we talked about enterprise and mid-market. The mid-market business in North America and Europe has always been a
catalyst of our growth, so midsized pharma companies. And here, we see momentum picking up of platform implementations, but also
single trials, large Phase II, Phase III trials. And that can be quite large and significant in terms of revenue contribution.
And then the last element is the baseline effect. We will have a new baseline effect, the rebalancing, which will be much more
favorable compared to last year. So we are back to -- we are able to build a backlog growth that has also a different baseline than
previously. So these are the effects that give us visibility and that we track quarter-to-quarter on how we are performing against that.
Operator
Now we're going to take our next question. And the next question comes from the line of Ben Castillo-Bernaus from BNP Paribas.
Ben Castillo-Bernaus
BNP Paribas Exane, Research Division
Can I just come back to the next quarter Q2's license guidance. The range is quite wide there versus what you typically give. I know
you touched on this already around you have some larger deals in the pipeline. But is this a new normal? Is Q2 particularly different
from others? Perhaps you can expand and just unpack on what's in that pipeline. Just give us a bit of a flavor.

Yes. So the way we designed the pipeline for the second quarter is we have good -- we have -- if I start with the geographical way to
look at it maybe, we expect cost acceleration in North America. Europe had good growth that I think is durable, and we'll continue to
see that also in the second quarter and has some potential to pick up.
Asia had a very good quarter with -- of course, driven by China, but also with good growth in Korea and Japan. And for all those
markets, we have good visibility and also the mix of pipeline from larger midsized and smaller transactions. We expect also CRE,
SOLIDWORKS to have a bigger impact in the second quarter growth than the first quarter growth.
And as you saw in the first quarter, there could be certain deals that can flip to a license with a subscription model that's sometimes
difficult to predict. And also the dependence on China and the impact China had in the first quarter, translating that to the second
quarter, we felt that we should give us a bit more flexibility on license depending on the evolution of how the conversion of pipeline to
revenue and deal closing will occur in the second quarter.
But I think we have a better structural pipeline in the second quarter than in the first quarter, specifically in North America, but also in
Europe.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 18Maybe a last question before we close the call.
Operator
Yes, of course. And now we're going to take our last question for today. And the question comes from the line of Toby Ogg from
JPMorgan.
Toby Ogg
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
I just wanted to come back on the cash flow comment. The Q1 operating cash flow should be 38% to 40% of the full year. I think
that implies close to EUR 1.7 billion of operating cash flow. So it doesn't really imply any kind of real improvement on the cash
conversion side versus sort of a lower level in 2023. So is that right interpretation of that comment?
And secondly, when do you expect an improvement in the cash conversion? And what gives you the confidence in that? And then also
just linked to the free cash flow as well. The CapEx looked like it was up a lot in the quarter. What was the driver of that? And are you
expecting higher CapEx going forward?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Thanks, Toby, for the question and the opportunity to clarify. So the -- if you do the -- if you -- if I look at the numbers, 38% to 40%.
If I -- if you take the 38%, the operating cash flow will be better than EUR 1.7 billion. It's closer to EUR 1.8 billion.
Now we want to give us a little bit of room because we have some volatility as we experienced this quarter. But definitely, the
comment on 10-plus percent operating cash flow improvement, that's what we expect for the year, and that has not changed. So the
volatility that we discussed this quarter in Q1 is -- the majority is timing related, and we will -- we expect Q2 to rebalance that already.
Maybe not in full, but we will see the progress that for H1, for the first 6 months, we will see similar conversion from operating
income to cash flow than what we had last year.
And then we will see on that as our, of course, our operating income is growing this year by around 10%, we will see that reflected in
the operating cash flow, plus some of the working capital improvements that we discussed previously that these are still to come.
So from that perspective, the outlook has not changed. I think there was just more clarification in terms of timing required that we see
in the quarter, and I think we've explained that. That was the first one. Toby, what was your second point?
Toby Ogg
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Just on the CapEx.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
CapEx, we are slightly higher, and that's mainly due to some of the investments we made into the expansion of our of our office space,
real estate. We've opened 2 new spaces that are driving some of the CapEx investments. But they are in the context of our growth
strategy. And so we also have -- that will -- yes, that's the reason.
Operator
There are no further questions for today.
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations

Operator
Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Dassault Systèmes Second Quarter and First Half 2024 Earnings
Presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Beatrix Martinez, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go
ahead.
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you, Sonja. From the company, we have today Pascal Daloz, CEO; and Rouven Bergmann, CFO. I would like to welcome you
to Dassault Systèmes second quarter and first half 2024 webcast presentation. At the end of the presentation, we will take questions
from participants. And later today, we will also hold a conference call.
Dassault Systèmes results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. Most of the financial figures in this conference call are presented on
a non-IFRS basis, with revenue growth rates in constant currencies, unless otherwise noted. For an understanding of the differences
between the IFRS and the non-IFRS, please see the reconciliation tables included in our press release.
Some of the comments we will make during today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements, which could differ
materially from actual results. Please refer to our risk factors in our 2023 Universal Registration Document published on March 18.
I will now hand over to Pascal Daloz.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Thank you, Beatrix. Good morning to everyone joining us on the call today. This morning, we issued our earnings press release
confirming the information we shared 2 weeks ago during the primary release and the call.
So few message on those. Our second quarter total revenue increased by 4%, and earnings per share rose by 8%. What have we
learned from that? First, the delay in customer decisions caught us by surprise in Q2. At the same time, looking ahead, we can confirm
we have a robust pipeline, which is structurally stronger in the second half compared to the first one. Additionally, we remain on track
to close this year the majority of the deal we have been delayed, and we see the maturity of opportunities as improving as we advance
through the year.
From a profitability standpoint, we are taking the required measures to preserve our operational efficiency and the long-term
investments. And therefore, we can confirm what we expect, which is an EPS up 8% to 11% this year.
Now let's discuss our business environment across the 3 sectors. If you can move to the next slide, please. In the Manufacturing
Industry, despite the recent volatility in the customer decisions and particularly in Aerospace & Defense, the demand for
3DEXPERIENCE platforms remained extremely strong, plus 23% for the first semester with several deals, including extension and
significant win backs. Our customers are still seeking innovative way to differentiate in the market and strengthen their customer
relationships.
Now zooming in Aerospace & Defense, customers have a huge backlog in front of them due to the manufacturing ramp-up delays,
which is caused by the supply bottlenecks. And these create cash flow issues and impacts their investment plan. However, despite
their investment pause in the near term, I think we are extremely confident that our solutions can help them to address these current
issues.
At the same time, we see Transportation & Mobility as very resilient and well represented in our second half pipeline as we are not
subject to the volume of production. This move towards electrification is driving the momentum for us, and the coexistence between
the thermal and electrical are creating, in fact, specific development environment where, I think, we are extremely well positioned.
Now zooming on consumer industries, we are growing strongly, and we expect this trend to continue in the second half. In addition,
we have a much better pipeline in H2 compared to H1, and I think with the right mix of volume and large transactions.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2024 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 25, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 5Now a few words in Life Sciences. We believe we are at the moment at the turning point and that the market contraction is behind us.
In other words, we have reached the bottom. At the same time, we have reinforced our position with increased market share and a new
innovation cycle as an evidence by the launch of our new products, so-called MEDIDATA Clinical Data Studio.
We officially launched these products at the end of June, and we have already achieved remarkable successes, including win back
clients. And this is -- we are using this as a competitive differentiator to expand our value proposal beyond the traditional EDC. We
believe, with this, we are completely transforming the clinical trial in the years to come, and I will explain why in a moment.
In Infrastructure, the momentum continues, driven by the deployment of the 3DEXPERIENCE in our existing accounts.
Now I would like to highlight 3 major competitive wins this quarter, and if you can move to the next slide, please. Let's start with
Mahindra & Mahindra first. They have selected the complete 3DEXPERIENCE portfolio for Transportation & Mobility and fully
adopting it for all the future vehicle programs. And more importantly, we are displacing a competitor solutions.
Being 100% cloud-based, it provides an out-of-the-box industry solutions, and this will be used initially with the 3 vehicles programs,
including their best sellers. And we will connect with the platform 3,500 users, including engineering services suppliers. In this
specific process, the data centricity part of the platform was a key decision factor because they aim to reduce the cycle times and gain
an edge against the increasing competition from China. And in this regard, the ability to source locally is extremely critical.
This is also the reason why they have chosen us, as we enable all the business decisions capability, if you want, to be integrated into
the early design phases, thereby maintaining a low cost. Ultimately adopting our platform enables also Mahindra & Mahindra to gain
unique competitive advantage and electrify most of their cars.
And finally, I think this win strategically reposition us in India, not only to use the India capacity we have built over the time to serve
the rest of the world, but to expand and to accelerate the growth of these markets.
Now if we move to the next one, so please can move to the next slide. Bristol-Myers Squibb, which is BMS, they have renewed its
partnership after a deep benchmarking exercise. And believe me, they have evaluated all the competitive product on the markets. And
finally, they are reconfirming their collaboration with MEDIDATA, and we are expanding a successful 10-year partnership by an
additional 5 years.
This new contract includes also access to MEDIDATA Rave, AI's capabilities and Clinical Data Studio, and it's driven by the
MEDIDATA ability to effectively manage BMS' complex and diversified clinical trial portfolio, which also includes cells and gene
therapies, which is pretty unique.
BMS has also adopted the Medidata Clinical Studio to integrate data from multiple sources, such as the traditional electric data
capture, the EDC; the electronic health record, which is usually the system used at the hospital; and more and more of the sensors,
while at the same time, we are maintaining a high standard of quality and integrity, which is related to the key points.
I think these expanded partnerships reflect the BMS' commitments to advancing clinical research processes and reinforce its
dedication to improve patient outcomes and personalized health care.
Now if we move to the next one, to the next customer cases, it's also an interesting one. You are maybe not aware about this company
called Marmon. It's a highly diversified company owned, by the way, by Berkshire Hathaway. And they are operating in industry like
construction, energy, industrial equipment and transportation.
And they have chosen the 3DEXPERIENCE SOLIDWORKS on the cloud for an integrated approach. And this decision, in fact,
involves replacing many, many legacy design and simulation point solutions, while incorporating advanced collaboration capability
at the same time. And I think with the 3DEXPERIENCE WORKS family, we are offering unique solutions that deliver an unmatched
return over investments compared to the traditional approach and demonstrating, I think, the relevance of the platform concept for the
mainstream.
If we move to the next slide. So in parallel, you know we are also actively developing AI-driven use cases to accelerate the future
growth across the 3 sectors of the economy we serve. And you know we are leveraging, in fact, our largest multi-industry data assets
as most of the manufactured products, drugs, large infrastructural equipment, are created with our software to generate, if you want,
those experiences. And here, I want to focus on 3 experiences available for our customers.
So if we move to the next slide. The first one is so-called system standard compliance by design. What does it do? It improve, in fact,
the process of writing requirement by using AI to read, interpret all the relevant regulations and norms, which is increasing in the
industry. And it then verifies that the design meets, if you want, the established performance criteria.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2024 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 25, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 6These solutions play a crucial role in helping specifically EV makers to address their current challenges and significantly reduce the
time to market. It also ensure the accuracy the first time and enable the life cycle change for over-the-air updates.
I think this increasing level of autonomy of the smart and connected products implies a rigorous traceability along the entire design
processes from the definition of the requirements to the end of the verification and validations process.
We are also collaborating with early adopters among the automotive OEMs and with the Tier 1 suppliers, and we plan to expand in
Aerospace & Defense shortly. And I think following this initial engagement, we will scale our solutions to other players.
Now if I zoom to the second topic, which is the Clinical Data Studio. It's a data management solutions, as I was explaining, which
provides a seamless access to integrate data from various sources. I was mentioning the electronic data capture, the electronic health
record systems and more and more of the sensors.
Previously, the information was added manually to the EDC systems. But now with Clinical Data Studio, it simplifies the data
aggregation, standardization and management workflows using AIs to do it. In fact, this is enabling multiple users to work at the same
time with real-time data, reducing the workload, speeding up the reviews, improving the qualities, reducing the risk and enhancing
ultimately the patient's safety. And this new approach is extremely critical. And this -- it will reshape the future of the clinical trial by
providing a single source of tools for compliance and regulations.
Now if we move to the third topic, the perfect consumer products. I think it's enabled the creation of unique experiences for mass-
personalization. And to serve a large number of customers quickly, those technology, AIs and automation, is at their crucial of
leveraging the customer data to drive generative experience. And this quarter, we are partnering with ASICS, the well-known
Japanese sportswear brand, to offer a personalized shoes capabilities.
And right now, building on the momentum of the Olympic games here in Paris, ASICS is opening several locations across the cities
where people can scan their feet to create customized running shoes with unique sole tailored for each individuals. And these shoes
can be manufactured on demand and locally, and this is also reducing the CO2 emission footprint.
For the one having the chance to come to visit us in the coming months, you will see this modular 3D printing manufacturing unit in
action because we set up the facilities on our campus for the time of the Olympic games. But more than the long explanation, we have
a short video to explain the concept. If you can run the video, please.
[Presentation]
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
We just issued the press release this morning, and I will have the pleasure to do the inauguration of this personal studio next Monday
with Tominaga-san, who will be on site with me to do these openings.
If we can move to the next slide. I think after reviewing the business environment across the 3 main sectors and highlighting some
new product cycle that will support the growth for the second half and the year and beyond, now I would like to conclude by
providing an overview of the trends by regions.
Europe remains resilient and continues to be the key anchor for growth. There is a strong demand for transformation in -- of the
European industry, particularly in Transportation & Mobility, Aerospace & Defense and Home & Lifestyle.
In North America, we expect accelerated growth in the second half of the year, in the core industry, with notable progress in
Aerospace & Defense and ongoing contribution from Transportation & Mobility as well as in the Life Sciences.
In Asia, the growth dynamics are well balanced across countries. India represents a strong opportunity ahead, while Korea and Japan
are expected to deliver consistent durable performance. And China is projected to grow, but remain subject to volatility.
So to wrap up, and before handing over to Rouven, I want to emphasize that we have achieved multiple win backs, and you have seen
it through my customer example, meaning that not only we are competing successfully, but we are also displacing the competition.
More than ever, I'm convinced that the platform approach is a key differentiator and more relevant than ever for our customers. And
this has given us the confidence in our growth potential for the second half of the year and beyond. While many experiences, we
experienced short-term volatility, I think we are still game changing for our -- many of our customers, and they value the most our
long-term approach.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2024 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 25, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7And now, Rouven, the floor is yours.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Thank you, Pascal, and hello to you joining our call today. First, I want to confirm our results of Q2 are in accordance with the
preliminary announcement from July 9.
Now let's review the performance of Q2 and the first 6 months in a bit more detail. Q2 software revenue was up 3%, with subscription
revenue at 8%, and upfront license revenue down by 1%. As discussed, we closed fewer large deals as we experienced cautiousness in
customer signings towards the very end of the quarter in a complex geopolitical environment.
The relative strength on the bottom line with an EPS at EUR 0.30 growing at 8% was driven by lower expense growth, strong interest
income from cash invested and a lower tax rate. The operating margin was 29.9%.
Looking at the first 6 months, total revenue was EUR 2.995 billion, up 5%, with an operating margin of 30.5% and EPS growth of
10% versus H1 of last year. Subscription revenue was up 9%. However, when excluding MEDIDATA, subscription growth was up
20% in H1 and 29% on a trailing 12-month basis at the end of June.
Clearly, the momentum continues to be strong, reflecting our customers' appetite for 3DEXPERIENCE platform and cloud. Important
to highlight, the MEDIDATA performance was largely in line with our expectations, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.
Now let me briefly review the deviations to the midpoint of our objectives of Q2. Total revenue came in at EUR 1.496 billion in the
quarter, which was EUR 44 million below the midpoint and EUR 29 million below the low end of our objectives, including a positive
currency impact.
This reflects the volatility in customer decision-making as mentioned. However, all important deals that have been delayed are still in
our roadmap for future quarters. And when purchase decisions are made, our win rates remain very strong.
Operating margin was 29.9%, below the low end of guidance. OpEx growth in Q2 was 5% and offset approximately half the impact
from the shortfall in revenue. Thanks to an effective hiring and expense policy, we reduced net headcount growth in the first 6 months
of 2024 to 270 FTE. Additionally, Q2 OpEx growth included a onetime benefit of approximately 1 point.
Now going forward in H2, we will dial up the hiring to support our long-term growth strategy and that every year in Q3, we are
onboarding interns and young graduates to fuel our talent pipeline.
As mentioned, EPS was EUR 0.30, in line with our objective. The combination of lower OpEx cost, very healthy financial income
and a lower tax rate offset the mix in revenue. As you can see, we have taken a prudent approach to fill up our EPS objectives, while
ensuring the necessary long-term investments.
Now turning to our growth drivers. Despite a more challenging business context in the second quarter, we saw sustainable growth
in 3DEXPERIENCE revenue, up 18% in Q2 and 23% in H1, driving the share to 36% of software revenue. This quarter, over 2/3
of our 3DEXPERIENCE growth was driven by deals larger than EUR 3 million, with the remainder generated by midsized deals.
Overall, this highlights the broad-based momentum and resilience of 3DEXPERIENCE growth, despite the elevated scrutiny in our
sales cycles at the end of Q2.
Cloud revenue grew 10% in Q2 and 8% in H1. Excluding MEDIDATA, cloud growth rose around 70% in Q2 and 60% in H1, driven
by strong momentum in the adoption of 3DEXPERIENCE cloud. In Q2, we had several large customers expanding their adoption of
the 3DEXPERIENCE platform on the cloud such as Mahindra & Mahindra, Honda, Biogen and Safran.
Now let's review our performance for Q2 and the first half by product line. Software revenue of Industrial Innovation grew 6% for the
first 6 months, led by strong growth in NETVIBES and data science, and the solid performance of ENOVIA and DELMIA growing
at high single digits. CATIA and SIMULIA growth was particularly affected by the increased deal scrutiny and delay in decision-
making, while the subscription run rate remains solid and embarks future growth.
Life Sciences' growth was minus 2% for H1, with MEDIDATA growth at minus 3%. This scenario was factored into our plan for the
first half. As we now transition to the second half, we believe that the period of post-COVID market contraction is largely behind us.
In Q2, we saw steady start volumes up sequentially for the first time since early 2022 after 2 years.
This -- the trend of progressive recovery continues in Q2. This is evident in the bookings performance, most notably in the study-
based volume business, thanks to an increase in CRO partner consumption. Also Patient Cloud bookings were up.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2024 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 25, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8While still early, we saw a good trend in bookings from new products launched in 2024. For the first time this quarter, we saw Clinical
Data Studio adopted by several enterprise customers, as Pascal highlighted during his presentation. We also renewed with our largest
sponsor, BMS, our multiyear contract. Importantly, BMS expanded the commitment, ramping up in 2025.
On the flip side, we saw fewer large deals in the quarter. However, we expect this trend to normalize as the share of large transactions
will grow with upcoming renewals in the next quarters, including 2025.
To conclude on Life Sciences. It is clear that we are competing well in the market. We continue to expand our market share in Phase
III trials by over 2 points and also in Phase I by over 0.5 point. All of the above contributes to the path of progressive recovery.
Moving on to Mainstream Innovation. We see continued strength mainly driven by Centric PLM and for SOLIDWORKS continued
adoption of subscription contracts while -- with existing and new customers, more than offsetting the decline in upfront license
revenue.
Now I'd like to briefly expand on the continued momentum of Centric PLM. This quarter, Centric PLM finds several large enterprise
deals, with leading brands such as Lacoste, HUGO BOSS and Shopsense, a Reliance Industries company in retail tech in India. Many
of those are displacements.
As evidenced by their track record, Centric PLM offers a highly integrated business platform for consumer-driven industries that
encompasses all aspects of product development, planning, pricing, inventory, market intelligence and more.
By bringing together product developers, planners, quality and compliance teams, buyers, merchandisers and designers, Centric PLM
optimizes every step of bringing a product to market. Consequently, we are well positioned to secure large-scale enterprise PLM
contracts. It's a completely different game.
Now turning on to cash flow and balance sheet IFRS items. Cash and cash equivalents totaled EUR 4.031 billion compared to EUR
3.568 billion at the end of 2023, which is an increase of EUR 463 million. At the end of the quarter, our net cash position totaled EUR
1.036 billion, an increase of EUR 458 million versus net cash of EUR 578 million at December 31, 2023. This clearly highlights a
disciplined and efficient capital allocation policy.
Now let's look at what drove our cash position at the end of the first half. We generated EUR 1.130 billion operating cash flow for the
first 6 months versus EUR 1.026 billion last year or a growth of 10%. As highlighted already in Q1, we delivered a positive catch-up
in the second quarter, thanks to strong collections and improvement in nonoperating working capital, mainly from lower tax payments
and expected reimbursement.
For the first 6 months, cash conversion from non-IFRS net income improved to 1.42x versus 1.39x last year. For any additional
information, you will find the operating cash flow reconciliation in our presentation, which we published also this month.
Now to sum up. Operating cash flow was mainly used for the net repurchase of treasury shares of EUR 273 million and a dividend
payment of EUR 303 million.
In terms of CapEx, we invested EUR 106 million in property and equipment, which is around EUR 40 million above last year's level
for H1. This is mainly due to global office expansions and IT-related CapEx to support our cloud cost.
We are investing in our operations in India. We are modernizing our DELMIA location in Detroit to strengthen our manufacturing
presence in the U.S. and further expand at our headquarters in Paris. Evidently, we are investing long term to support our growth, and
we are convinced that our workplaces are the foundation for collaboration, innovation and our strong culture.
Now let's transition to our full year outlook. Over the first 6 months, we made continuous progress in advancing our growth drivers of
3DEXPERIENCE and cloud. While we signed fewer large deals in H1, the number of midsized transactions is up 8% in the quarter
and over 10% for H1.
At the same time, we experienced an elevated scrutiny in our sales cycles across major geos in Europe and NAM, North America,
specifically in the Aero & Defense industry at the end of the second quarter.
Now as we look ahead to H2, we see -- we continue to see a healthy demand for our solutions and our customer base, primarily from
platform adoption, the value network and domain expansion. Our pipeline coverage is well aligned with historical trends.
Taking all these factors into account, consistent with our preannouncement from July 9, we are updating our full year objectives with
total revenue now in the range of EUR 6.260 billion to EUR 6.335 billion, representing a growth of now 6% to 8% versus the previous
guidance of EUR 6.350 billion to EUR 6.425 billion or 8% to 10% growth.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2024 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 25, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9For software revenue, we now expect 7% to 8% growth, driven by upfront license revenue in the range of 3% to 5% versus 2% to 5%
previously and recurring revenue of 8% to 9% versus 10% to 11% previously.
Subscription revenue is now in the range of 13% to 15% previously versus 17% to 19%. This reflects the delay in customer signings,
which impacted mainly large subscription contracts.
Finally, we expect services revenue in the range of 3% to 5% versus 8% to 9% previously.
From a bottom line perspective, we now expect an operating margin in the range of 32% to 32.4%, which is flat year-over-year at the
midpoint, and an EPS in the range of 8% to 11% growth or EUR 1.27 to EUR 1.30. The tax rate is updated to 19.5% for the full year
versus 20.5% previously.
Now I would like to share some additional points to help shape your models reflecting the Q3 outlook. The first comment is regarding
the baseline comparison. Q3 2024, as you remember, is the anniversary of our JLR mega deal, which is creating a challenging year-
over-year comp.
As such, we expect total revenue growth in the range of 4% to 7%, with software revenue of 3% to 6%, driven by a recurring revenue
of 7% to 9%. Subscription revenue is estimated to grow between 12% to 17%. In this outlook, we expect MEDIDATA to improve
sequentially and be flattish.
Operating margin is expected in the range of 29.4% to 30.2% and EPS between EUR 0.28 to EUR 0.29, which is up 1% to 6% year-
over-year.
Now to keep in mind, the JLR effect is over 3 points on the revenue, visible in upfront license and about 120 basis points on the
operating margin. And the EPS impact of JLR year-over-year is about EUR 0.03.
Now before I conclude, I would like to share a few remarks on the trajectory of the second half, for which we are now expecting 9%
growth. This implies an increase of around EUR 300 million in revenue versus H1.
2/3 of this sequential growth is related to normal seasonality. The remaining 1/3 is roughly split between the slip deals that we are
targeting to sign in H2 and the impact of the back-end loaded year, which also encompasses both 3DEXPERIENCE and MEDIDATA.
In conclusion, I want to reiterate our commitment to investing to support long term, while expanding our margins. We continue to
see strong customer demand and engagement across our 3DEXPERIENCE portfolio, a Centric PLM platform and the MEDIDATA
solutions, all supporting our financial objectives near and midterm.
Now Pascal and I would like to -- looking forward to your questions.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2024 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 25, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will now take the first question from the line of Frederic Boulan from Bank of America.
Frederic Emile Alfred Boulan
BofA Securities, Research Division
So first of all, on MEDIDATA, would be interesting to spend a bit of time on strategy with new CEO, Anthony Costello, now driving
the business. Coming back on the visibility you have, because you mentioned improving bookings, but that was already your message
at the back end of last year and hasn't delivered revenue. So if you can explain a little bit what you see in terms of bookings, but also
duration of those contracts and the lead time.
And then I think you saw clarification on the shape of this year, so you expect around flattish revenue in Q3. You keep the ambition to
be around flat for the year because that implies a kind of more than 5% growth in Q4. So it would be interesting to understand whether
that's realistic prospect for this year.
And then secondly, if I may, around the free cash flow. So any commentary there? Should we expect free cash flow to grow -- or cash
flow from operations to grow in line with EBIT? Any specific working capital or other items you want to identify and site?
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Rouven, can I take the first part of the question related to the new management, and then you will speak about the trajectory from
MEDIDATA?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes, yes.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
So you are right to highlight the fact that we have a new management team leading MEDIDATA. The name of the CEO is Anthony
Costello, and he's really an innovator. He was the founder of Patient Cloud, which is extremely important because, as you may know,
we are evolving the clinical trial towards the patient centricity, and he is the man behind this.
To say more, I encourage you to attend the next events that are going to take place in New York in the second half of the year because
we will come back with a comprehensive strategy and give you many, many insight to how we are repositioning MEDIDATA for the
future.
Maybe Rouven on the trajectory?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes. Frederic, thank you for your questions, and I'll address them in the order you spoke.
On the conversion of bookings, first, the bookings are converting to backlog and from backlog to revenue. I think in a normal market
environment, you're right. Bookings, immediately as they transition to backlog, are recognized in the next quarter as revenue. But
please keep in mind, in the last 12 months, we were operating in an environment where the market contracted year-over-year by 10%
and over 2 years over 15%.
So this means that a lot of the trials that ended, didn't -- they didn't continue. And a number of large trials from the COVID period
were creating a difficult comparison for us, as we were moving from -- over 2023 into 2024.
Remember, Q1 of 2023 was still a strong quarter. We are now 12 months later, 15 months later. It took us this time to offset the
market compression of clinical trial starts in our backlog, to stabilize our backlog, to be now have the visibility to be back to
sequential growth.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2024 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 25, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11And this is EUR 1 billion business where about 35% is based on volume, where another 1/3 is related to the mid-market that has
also shorter cycles to adjust. But the large enterprise market has been very stable. And we have been renewing with all of our large
customers, and BMS is another example that we highlighted this quarter.
So I think this is an important context to keep the view on what it takes to digest this COVID bubble. It took us 1 year. And as we
said, we are entering a new phase in H2, where we are back to sequential growth.
It will be progressive. We are focused on driving sustainable growth in our backlog to deliver this consistently. And we have now the
visibility also given not only that the clinical trial starts have stabilized, but now we start to see them up sequentially.
And it's also visible in the bookings consumption of our partners, who consume more clinical trials. Patient Cloud continues to be a
differentiator, and also we saw that in the second quarter. And now we're also entering a new cycle of innovation, while still early, but
it starts to contribute and it's a build differentiator in enterprise renewals.
So on the year-over-year, what do we expect here for the year? We said we were going to be flattish for Q3. We are expecting growth
for Q4. So all in all, we are targeting to be flat for the year. That's the objective.
To the free cash flow, operating cash flow, we -- as you heard from me, we are -- we have made good progress in the second quarter
to rebalance the working capital movement from the first quarter. Now we are net positive, 10% growth. For the full year, we are
expecting 8% to 10% growth for operating cash flow. This also implies an improvement in cash flow conversion from operating
income. In 2023, we were at around 81% of conversion. We expect to be -- to improve that in the range of 84% to 85% for 2024.
And how are we doing that? We are managing our operating working capital. We are -- I think we collected extremely well in the
second quarter, and we expect this trend to continue. At the same point in time, we have -- with the delay of some of the larger
transactions will also have a muted impact in the second half of the year because those deals will be collected later. That will be
moving into 2025, but that's factored into our objectives. So we have seen an improvement versus 2023, and it's in line with the
growth in EPS.
Operator
We will now take the next question from the line of Christopher Tong from UBS.
Michael Briest
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
It's Michael Briest. Just in terms of MEDIDATA continuing there, the ambition was to get to double-digit revenue growth at some
point in 2025, given another quarter of visibility. Have you got any sense on whether that's achievable exiting H1 or maybe H2?
And then in terms of cloud, how does the lower growth of MEDIDATA today and for some quarters affect your outlook on that EUR
3 billion ambition in 2028? The core business has obviously contributed well. Do you think that can compensate over the medium
term?
And then just a quick bit of housekeeping. I see the tax rates come down to 19.5%, Rouven. It was 20.5% previously in the guidance.
Is that a sustainable level going forward or just something to do with the shifting in profits this year?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Okay. Let's start with MEDIDATA, Michael. I'm going through your laundry list. The answer is, yes, H2 is the target to be achieving
double-digit growth in 2025. As I said, we are focused on building sustainable growth, which will be reflected on our backlog growth
going forward with sequential improvement. And that should lead us to double-digit growth in the back half of 2025.
On the cloud, you are right. We are -- we see strong progress on the 3DEXPERIENCE cloud adoption. Mahindra & Mahindra is a
fantastic example, as Pascal mentioned. It is an adoption of the entire full portfolio. It reflects the strong investments we have made
over the years in R&D. And now with the data centricity and AI, we have a real advantage in the market. And our customers, they
realize and see that. So it becomes a competitive edge for us.
Despite the MEDIDATA's lower contribution, which will pick up in 2025, we are confident in our cloud target of EUR 3 billion. And
70% growth, it is a very strong example -- it's a very strong performance. And the base is starting to be becoming large. So it's a big
growth on an increasing basis.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2024 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 25, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12On the tax -- for the tax, we had a few adjustments in the quarter. You're right. The first adjustment -- there are two things that need
to be understood. The first is a successful completion of an ongoing order that completed in Q2. That has brought around 30% of the
improvement. So that's more of a onetime effect.
The second element is a risk assessment that we took on our tax provisions related to the U.S., where we've made some adjustments
that we are now projecting going forward to be the case. So there is a positive impact from that going forward, and that's about 50% of
the data versus guidance and Q2 actual.
And then there's another piece, which is related to an annual assessment that we do every time in Q2 based on the tax credits we
receive for R&D investments in France. And as we are conservative in the way we reflect that, typically, we always true this up once
we have the final results, which is typically in Q2.
So this in aggregate makes the 3 points, of which half of it is a favorable impact going forward. But there can be discrete items that
come on top of that to reduce this effect in upcoming -- in 2025. So we'll have to assess that carefully in 2025.
But overall, there are some onetime elements. There are some elements that will trail into 2025. But this needs to be taken with some
caution -- cautiousness because there can be other elements that can offset that, that we'll need to assess the future.
Operator
We will now take the next question from the line of Adam Wood from Morgan Stanley.
Adam Dennis Wood
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
I've got two, please. The first one is just looking into the second half of the year. Obviously, some of the benefits you expect in H2 is
from the delayed deals getting signed. I would say in the past, if the background environment doesn't change, if deals have slipped Q2,
it wouldn't be a surprise to see deals slip Q3 and Q4. So what you get back, you might lose.
Could you just talk a little bit around how you think about that risk, how dependent on mega deals you are? And is there anything that
you're doing to try to mitigate that risk in terms of getting part of them to close, focusing on cutting them into smaller pieces, whatever
it is to lower those risks around big deals and continuing to see deals slip through the second half?
And then secondly, again, coming back to MEDIDATA. Could you give us a little bit of an idea of what the upsell potential is of the
new products that you're launching? I know Patient has new with the Clinical Data Studio is. You're just an idea of size, 100%. Where
could we get to? And are we seeing those coming through kind of now in renewals? Or is that something that we should expect more
for 2025?
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Thank you, Adam. I will take the first one, and I will make a very short answer. If you look at the guidance, the low end and the
midpoint are not requesting to have mega deals. The high end need them. And if we are capable to conclude all of them, we could
outperform. That's how we have built the guidance.
MEDIDATA?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
MEDIDATA, sure, I'll make it short as well. The new innovation has been received extremely well by our customers. In fact, we have
already 3 large enterprise customers who are adopting it. And these are not proof of concept. They are real value and paying. It's in the
millions.
But I also want to caution and say it's early days. We want to ramp this up carefully, and the references is everything at this point in
time that matters. But it's already contributing to our recovery. And it's a major part of our positioning going forward.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Just to complement what you say, Rouven. You are right, Adam. This product -- this new product is automatically part of the renewal.
And it's a way for us not to renew at parity, but to renew in the norm we used to have, which is 20-plus.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2024 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 25, 2024

We will now take the next question from the line of Deepshikha Agarwal from Goldman Sachs.
Deepshikha Agarwal
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
I think a lot of them have been answered, but just two. One is, basically, can you just give some color? I know on SOLIDWORKS, the
subscription transition, as you said, has been going well. So how do we see that tracking and especially in terms of from here to the
high single-digit, low double-digit growth in that product line?
And then second is your guidance implies roughly 7% growth in OpEx. So how should we think about the puts and takes of the cost
development in the second half? And anything on investments in the second half and even 2025 for that matter?
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Okay. So I will take the first one, Rouven. Again, if we go straight to the point, the goal for us this year with SOLIDWORKS is
to definitively accelerate the subscriptions and being in a position to offset the decrease of the upfront license. And I think we are
achieving this goal. And this is an important one because next year, we will not have any more of the base effects on the upfront
license we have this year.
So automatically, we are recreating more than a high single-digit growth, if not double-digit growth for 2025. And I think we are
extremely pleased with the momentum. We see the adoption of the subscriptions going extremely well across all the regions of the
world, except China for obvious reasons. So that's what I can say.
Rouven, for...
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
On the OpEx, Deepshikha, the OpEx is, you're right, 7%-ish growth for the full year. Q2 was much lower at around 5%. With the 7%
and the work that we have done coming into the year to manage the costs tightly, we have created a room for making investments
in the second half. And that corresponds to my comment that we are going to dial up the hiring in the second half, of course, in a
controlled way.
We will be starting in Q3 with the young graduates and young talent program to bring them on -- into the company. And we will see
in Q3 a step-up in headcount -- net headcount cost in Q3. And then in Q4, we are working on our pipeline and prioritization. Not much
more to say.
Operator
That is all the time we have for questions this morning. I would like to hand back over to the speakers for closing remarks.
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
Okay.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
So I would like to thank you for you attending this call. And again, few takeaway for you. I think our fundamental are extremely solid.
Our offer are clearly differentiated on the markets, and you can witness this with the competitive displacements we are doing.
If you look at, we have a robust pipeline ahead, which is structurally stronger than in second half compared to the first one. And we
remain on track to close this year the majority of the large deals, which have been delayed.
Third, I think you hear me clearly stating this. I think we have derisked the guidance.
And finally, I'm still convinced we are well positioned to deliver the sustainable double-digit EPS growth for the future. So I think
that's what you should remind from this call.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ2 2024 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 25, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 4Presentation
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
Good morning, everyone. I'm Beatrix Martinez, Dassault Systèmes VP, Investor Relations. From the company, we have Pascal Daloz,
CEO; and Rouven Bergmann, CFO.
I would like to welcome you to Dassault Systèmes Third Quarter 2024 Presentation. At the end of the presentation, we will take
questions from participants first in the room and then online. Later today, we will also hold a conference call.
Dassault Systèmes results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. Most of the financial figures in this conference call are presented on
a non-IFRS basis with revenue growth rates in constant currencies, unless otherwise noted. For an understanding of the differences
between the IFRS and the non-IFRS, please see the reconciliation tables included in our press release.
Some of the comments we will make during today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements, which could differ
materially from actual results. Please refer to our risk factors in our 2023 Document d'enregistrement universel published on March
18.
And I will now hand over to Pascal Daloz.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Thank you, Beatrix, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call, and thank you for the one being with us in the room. Really,
it's always a good moment to be with us.
As you know, we issued our press release this morning for our third quarter 2024, so let me give you the tone first. So our Q3 results
were in line, showing 4% revenue growth, driven by an 8% increase in subscriptions, and the year-to-date subscriptions grew by 9%.
The EPS increased 8%, reflecting the solid overall performance.
And I would like to take and to highlight 3 key elements for the quarter. The first one is we have seen several end markets gaining
momentum, specifically in Life Science, where MEDIDATA is back to sequential growth. At the same time, we had an excellent
performance in consumer industries, driven by CENTRIC PLM, and SOLIDWORKS accelerated growth in revenue and seats. And
my last comment is importantly, I think the Aerospace & Defense demonstrates resilience and delivered a solid performance this
quarter.
The second message is we have seen, since last late summer, the automotive customers, typically in Europe and in U.S., which have
been impacted by the contractions in volumes. And this accelerate the need for transformation decisions while, at the same time, it
can elongate, if you want, the decision-making in the short term. In contrast, I think in Asia, specifically in China, the momentum
remained extremely strong.
Finally, I think stepping back a little bit, we are well positioned to continue gaining market share with our robust pipeline in the
industrial sectors. I think we are confident that the 3DEXPERIENCE platform with the data centricity will serve as a catalyst for our
customer transformation in the age of AI, and virtualizing the industrial processes from design to manufacturing will be a prerequisite
for many OEMs and suppliers to compete successfully in the next decade.
In the light of those factors, we reconfirm the full year EPS range from EUR 1.27 to EUR 1.30, and we anticipate a revenue growth
acceleration in Q4, nevertheless, adjusted due to the slowdown in the automotive sector. And this acceleration is driven by the strength
of the 3DEXPERIENCE pipeline.
Now let's dive into some key observations across the 3 main sectors of the economy we serve. First, if I zoom in the Manufacturing
Industries, I will state I was already making the comment, but the key point is, really, the automotive makers have downgraded their
2024 forecast since last summer, now predicting a 1% to 2% decline in car productions, instead of previously anticipated growth. And
this downgrade primarily impacts us in Europe and, to a later extent, in the U.S., while we continue to see a very strong growth in
China.
Simultaneously, several other end markets are showing excellent momentum. Aerospace & Defense delivered a good performance this
quarter, driven by our robust defense contracts and suppliers' contributions.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 5On the diversification front, I think we achieved an exceptional performance in Home & Lifestyle with CENTRIC PLM, and Rouven
give -- will give more detail about this. And we consistently are winning new clients and securing the several large deals and strategic
deals also.
In the High Tech, we also delivered robust growth this quarter, broad-based, but particularly also in Asia. And SOLIDWORKS
accelerated its revenue growth to mid-single digits, while -- with the seat growth, which is on the high single digits while, at the same
time, we are transitioning to subscription and cloud. And now this is representing about 1/3 of the bookings.
This diversity of the market we address, I think, brings resilience to our business model. And I think looking in Q3, there is also a
point I really want to highlight is the competitiveness, which remains extremely robust. In Q3, to give you an order of magnitude, we
have secured almost 100 significant competitive deals across key markets, China, Korea, France, Germany and North America, but
also in sectors like Aerospace High Tech, Industrial Equipment, also Transportation & Mobility.
The key point is 1/3 of those deals has involved, in fact, a competitive displacement, which is, I think, the demonstration of our clients
recognizing the value of our solutions. And if there is a good thing in certain domain where it's a little bit more difficult than it used to,
this is foreseeing certain customer choices, and I think we are well positioned.
A few words related to Life Sciences. I know it was something you guys put under scrutiny. And Q3 demonstrated, I think, a broad-
based improvement for MEDIDATA, driven by a few things. First of all, the market recovery, and it's a second consecutive quarter in
growth of the clinical trial starts.
But also we experienced this positive engagement with our customers across enterprise and mid-markets, but also with our CRO
partners. As we previously discussed, we are also benefiting from a new innovation cycle. Last quarter, we launched Medidata
Clinical Studio, which was end of June. And this quarter, we are launching light versions of Rave, which has been designed for the
early and the late studies. And as you may know, this phase and this market is extremely fragmented. And I think we have a way
probably to dig the fragmented market by leveraging the reach across all the different stages. In terms of market share, we continue
to strengthen our position, and we extend our reach to clinical trials to Manufacturing and PLMs. So in conclusion, I think this new
innovation cycle is starting to pay off.
Zooming in Infrastructures & Cities, I think we -- as you know, we have few dominant players in this space, but we continue to gain
references, specifically in the energy sector, which demonstrate our ability to disrupt the market with our data-centric experience
platform and support our customer with their build and run processes.
Now let me spotlight some key wins we have this quarter. The first one, and I take this one on purpose, it's BYD, right? All of you,
you know BYD. And we're expanding our partnership with them. And we -- specifically this quarter, we are focusing on the ModSims
for battery and new energy vehicle developments.
Why I was taking this as a reference? It's because Europe is under pressure, but we are gaining a lot of momentum in Asia in the
auto sector. And BYD, as you know, is probably one of the key references. And this deal again demonstrate our ability to continue
to expand in a domain where, believe me, it -- this deal was highly competitive because it was already remaining to focusing on the
battery developments and simulation and certifications. And you could imagine all the traditional players who were competing against
us.
The second example and customer case I have selected is Merck. Why Merck? It's because we are expanding our partnership focusing
on patient centricity. And for the ones who are following us, you know that Merck is usually used as a reference by Viva. So this is,
again, a way to demonstrate to you that with the new solutions we are bringing on the market, we are progressively displacing what
the clinical trial is about, integrating more and more this patient centricity, which is the core of what we do.
So here, what we do, we are broadening our partnership to support key studies in various therapeutic areas, including the Phase III on
the infectious disease to this. But also, as you may know, we are completing the footprint we already have at Merck on the oncology
studies. The net of this partnership is adding 1,400 new patients across 400 sites, adding to the 10,000 we are already participating and
supporting in the decentralized clinical trial.
The last one I picked, it's an interesting one. The company is so called Snam, and it's a leading natural gas transport operator in
Europe, in Italy. And they are managing 38,000 pipeline network. I picked this one because they are selected -- Snam has selected the
3DEXPERIENCE platform to digitally transform the management and the optimization of the gas network.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 6And why this is an interesting one it's because this win back is very similar to the one I presented a few quarters ago with Red
Eléctrica, if you remember, the Spanish electricity distribution network. This was -- it was a win back, so it was against a displacement
of Bentley, which was widely used inside this company.
So what do they do with the -- with our solutions? In fact, Snam is relying on the -- our solutions to do a few things. First, to create
the virtual twins of the existing and the future assets, giving them the ability to optimize the asset operations, but also to improve the
safety and to improve also and to reduce the emissions, which is something very important for this industry.
But it's also another way for them to extend, if you want, the ecosystem of assets and operators to ensure that they will be able to have
a predictable supply of energy throughout Italy and internationally, which is something extremely important because the demand is
fluctuating a lot. And having this ability to predict and to ensure that the network will be able to support the capacity requesting is
extremely important right now.
So I think this case is a good illustration against our ability to combine the real-world data, the one which are coming from the
operation with the model-based approach. And I think this is a game changer. And progressively, we are finding our way in this space.
The last comment I want to make is really related to AI. I know it's a big topic for you, but there are a few things I want you to keep in
mind. The first one is, remember, we have the largest and the most diversified install base in the market, which means that we process,
if you want, indirectly the largest cost base of data -- industrial data, but as well as business data and science data.
So in a way to use this as a strategic asset to maximize the potential AI, what do we do? We combine the AI with the ModSim
approach in order to -- if you want to transform those set of data into knowledge and expertise and ultimately creating the generative
experiences.
And as you can see on this framework, what I did, I took all the different steps of Dassault Systèmes for the last 40 years and I
showcase, because those applications are live today, how we are leveraging AI for different purpose.
One is to put the knowledge and the know-how in the hand of the nonexperts. This is, for example, what we do with what we call
the generative assembly. To connect design and engineering and manufacturing, this is, for example, what we do in the generative
shopfloor, where, automatically, the system is capable to generate the shopfloor, the processes, the manufacturing will follow to
master the system of systems, which is really what you can see in the generative infrastructure, for example, but also to achieve more
and more the mass personalization at scale.
And here, I took an interesting case for you, which is how from the video and images we are capable in Life Sciences to recreate the
3D model of the organs, not only the brain or the heart, but any kind. So this is really transformative. And I think if you look at what
we do, I'm claiming that there is no one single competitor capable to do this.
Now before handing over to Rouven, who will give you the details on the numbers, there are a few things I want to remind to you. The
first one is, really, our 3DEXPERIENCE platform is powerful differentiator. And remember, we are unifying. It's unified. It's cloud
native. It's data-centric, and it's pretty unique on the market. And why I'm saying this is because in all the sector where the pressure is
extremely high, I think more and more, we are making the difference.
Second, this differentiation resonate with our customers, and we have been able to demonstrate significant win back and wins, and I
think -- without compromising on the value of our solutions, which is probably something Rouven will come back on this.
And the third is, I think, the 3DEXPERIENCE pipeline for the rest of the year is high, healthy, and I think it supports with confidence
the accelerations in terms of growth we are targeting for Q4 with a midpoint at 8%.
Now Rouven, the floor is yours.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Thank you, Pascal, and hello to everyone of you here in London. And also thank you for those joining on our call this morning.
As you heard from Pascal, the Q3 results were overall in line with our objectives. While the total revenue at 4% and software revenue
growth at 3% came in at a lower end of the range, profitability was good with operating margin at 29.6%, at the midpoint of our
guidance, and EPS at EUR 0.29, at the higher end of the objectives.
Yes, as you heard from Pascal, in Q3, we faced headwinds with our automotive customers in Europe and in the U.S. due to volume
contractions. We see this as a short-term challenge impacting the timing of decisions. It was a factor in several pursuits this quarter.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7However, what's important, we are confident that the 3DEXPERIENCE platform addresses the needs of this industry, as evidenced by
our midterm pipeline. To complete the Q3 picture, subscription revenue was 8% cost and upfront license revenue was down by 7%.
Now 2 additional comments. First, as you know, Q3 is the anniversary of the mega deal we had last year, which added a significant
headwind to close this quarter on the software revenue and particularly on the license revenue.
Second, subscription growth remains strong when excluding the temporarily lower contribution from MEDIDATA, 19% for the
quarter and 20% year-to-date. The momentum reflects the continued healthy demand for the 3DEXPERIENCE platform and cloud.
Important to highlight, the MEDIDATA performance was in line with our expectations, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.
Looking at the first 9 months, total revenue was EUR 4.5 billion, up 4%, driven by subscription revenue growth of 9%, operating
margin of 30.2% and EPS of 8% growth, highlighting the resilient financial model, despite the back-end loaded year.
Now let me briefly review the deviations to the midpoint of our objectives for Q3. Total revenue came in at EUR 1.464 billion in
the third quarter, at the low end of our objectives, excluding a negative currency impact. This performance reflects the headwinds
evidenced by our automotive clients.
Operating margin was 29.6%, in the middle of our guidance range. Lower revenue was offset by effective cost containment. OpEx
growth in Q3 was 6%. EPS was EUR 0.29, with a tax rate largely in line with guidance and financial income at peak. Starting Q4, we
expect the contribution from financial income to be more muted due to rate cuts and the bond repayment that occurred in Q3.
We continue to take a disciplined approach to managing our business in the current environment in order to preserve our EPS
objective, but we continue to invest in innovation to support our long-term growth potential.
Turning to our growth drivers. Looking at our growth drivers, I will focus on the year-to-date trend going forward as there can be
quarter-to-quarter fluctuations impacting by the timing of large deals. The key message is that despite the current headwinds, the
growth momentum with 3DEXPERIENCE and cloud remain resilient.
Subscription revenue growth in 3DEXPERIENCE was 57% year-to-date, driving the share of 3DEXPERIENCE platform to now 37%
of software revenue, up 3% versus last year year-to-date Q3. This highlights the strength and the potential for revenue acceleration in
the midterm. Our top 5 new 3DEXPERIENCE subscription deals in the quarter generated about 1/4 of the growth.
Cloud revenue was 7% year-to-date. Ex MEDIDATA, cloud revenue increased to 52% for the first 9 months, driven by strong
momentum in the adoption of 3DEXPERIENCE Cloud. We had several customers expanding their adoption of the 3DEXPERIENCE
platform this quarter, such as EDF, BoConcept, Conforama France, Dallara Automobile and Horse Powertrain, all on the cloud.
Now with this, let's go through the performance for the first 9 months of our geos and then the product lines. Across Europe and the
Americas, we saw the impact of the weak auto sector in Q3. In the Americas, software revenue was up 6% in the quarter, and that
momentum was led by mainstream innovation with an exceptional performance in Home & Lifestyle and an increasing momentum of
SOLIDWORKS.
Europe was down minus 4% in the third quarter, remember, largely due to the very high comps. At the market segment level, the
performance across the region was mixed, highlighted by the good results in the West and Central parts of Europe, while not due to
the high comps and the Mediterranean region were rather soft.
Performance in Asia remained on track with 9% growth in the quarter and year-to-date. Unlike Europe and the Americas,
Transportation & Mobility was strong, particularly in China. Also High Tech had a good quarter in the region. China, up double digit
in the quarter and year-to-date as investment in the technology sector continued at healthy levels. Japan, Korea, India were up mid-
single digits in the quarter.
Now over to the product lines. The impact of delayed decision-making headwinds on growth is most visible in Industrial Innovation,
which is up 4% for the first 9 months and minus 1% for the quarter. The reacceleration of growth is associated with deals in our
pipeline that will drive this momentum in the future.
One of the highlights of the quarter was a strong progression of SIMULIA, up high single digits. Pascal talked about BYD. They
expanded the use of our SIMULIA solutions for multiphysics simulation, including all domains. To complement, they also signed
deals with [ Salba ], HKMC and Honda Motors in China. Despite the lower total software revenue growth in Industrial Innovation, the
moment in subscription continues strongly at 20% growth.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8Now over to Life Sciences. We saw in Q3 the anticipated acceleration with sequential growth improvements for MEDIDATA. This
uptick was driven mainly by continuous rebound in our study based booking growth over the last 4 consecutive quarters.
Also we saw broad-based momentum across enterprise and mid-market clients, as well as CROs globally. Just to name a few
customers that expanded relationships, with [ Zoka ], Merck, Daiichi Sankyo, Revolution Medicines, Immunovant, Ipsen, BeiGene,
EBERTH and Solventum. These are just a few.
We are signing more deals. However, on the flip side, we also saw fewer large deals in the quarter, similar to Q2. As mentioned
during our Q2 call, we expect this trend to normalize as the share of large transactions will grow with upcoming renewals over the
next quarters.
From a market perspective, it is now the second consecutive quarter with sequential growth in global clinical trial starts. While the
increases over the last 6 months remained rather small in absolute terms, the trend is positive.
In terms of market share, we continue to gain share across all phases by 1 point on a trailing 12-month basis. This is driven by resilient
momentum in pivotal Phase III and an uptick in late Phase IV studies. Phase I and II market share remains marginally unchanged.
And as you probably saw in our press release from last week, we are doubling down on the early and late phase market. This is a very
fragmented market, as Pascal explained, and we believe we can consolidate it with the new offer Rave Lite.
The highlight this quarter was Mainstream Innovation with 15% growth in the third quarter. SOLIDWORKS had a good start in the
second half of 2024, up mid-single digits in revenue and volumes. Centric delivered an outstanding quarter featured by competitive
displacement and strong renewals with healthy expansions across the platform.
Now a few more comments that highlight the strong performance of CENTRIC PLM. You have seen this chart now a few times, but
it's evolving. We are adding more logos to it, and it's expanding as evidenced by the numbers. Because the Centric team has made
significant progress over the last 4 to 6 quarters in scaling the operation at a global level, it is evident in the growth trajectory and the
value captured, reflected in large transactions.
The deals this quarter are spanning across retail, apparel, sports and cosmetics and including significant platform expansions. In Q3,
competitive wins were PVH in the U.S. ASOS in U.K. and Kmart, a leading retailer in Australia.
Turning now to cash flow and balance sheet IFRS items. Cash and cash equivalents totaled EUR 3.658 billion compared to EUR 3.568
billion at the end of 2023, an increase of EUR 89 million. At the end of September, our net cash position totaled EUR 1.066 billion
versus EUR 578 million in December 31, 2023.
Now let's look at the levers, the key levers impacting our cash position at the end of the third quarter. We generated EUR 1.353
billion of operating cash flow year-to-date versus EUR 1.272 billion last year. It reflects a growth of 6%. For the first 9 months, cash
conversion from non-IFRS operating income was at 100%, which is 95% at the same time last year. For further detail, please see our
operating cash flow reconciliation in our presentation published this morning.
To summarize, main drivers are the increase in net income adjusted for noncash items, lower tax payments, partially offset by lower
compensation accruals and timing of payments for accounts payable.
Operating cash flow uses were as follows year-to-date. First, for financing purposes, we repaid EUR 700 million of bonds used to
finance the MEDIDATA acquisition, which came due in September, offset by EUR 300 million of new commercial paper issuance.
We repurchased treasury stock net of proceeds from the exercise of stock options of EUR 329 million and paid EUR 303 million in
dividends.
Second, in terms of investing activities, we invested EUR 142 million in property, plant and equipment, of which EUR 89 million
is related to IT CapEx supporting our growth. And the rest of EUR 53 million mainly to expand and modernize our office space
and presence in France, the U.S. as well as India. We reiterate our commitment to invest and foster our culture of collaboration and
innovation across our locations.
Now let's take a look at our full year outlook. Over the first 9 months, we experienced a certain volatility in key end markets, such as
aerospace and now automotive, impacting the time to advance our large deal pipeline. This is clearly visible in Industrial Innovation.
On the flip side, we are seeing the Life Science's market stabilizing with MEDIDATA, advancing its progress back to growth. Also
SOLIDWORKS accelerated growth in Q3, and CENTRIC PLM continues to outperform, expanding deal sizes across an increasing
scope of verticals.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9Now with this in mind, I have 3 key messages before outlining our Q4 and full year objectives. First, we are committed to deliver the
EPS growth unchanged versus previous guidance of EUR 1.27 to EUR 1.30. This reflects strong operating efficiency and commitment
to our midterm objectives.
Second, our pipeline of large 3DEXPERIENCE opportunities remain strong over the next quarters, and we are confident in growth
acceleration in Q4.
Third, provided that the timing of decision-making can be less predictable in the current environment, we want to be cautious and
adjust total revenue growth for the year to 5% to 7% growth, down from 6% to 8% previously.
Now consequently, total revenue is now in the range of EUR 6.155 billion to EUR 6.275 billion versus previously EUR 6.260 billion
to EUR 6.335 billion. As you can see, we are increasing the range to EUR 120 million to reflect a larger variance of outcomes in Q4,
while still expecting solid acceleration at the midpoint to 8% growth in Q4.
For software revenue, we expect 5% to 7% growth for 2024, with upfront license revenue in the range of minus 1% to plus 6% and
recurring revenue up 6% to 7%. Subscription revenue is anticipated to be in the range of 10% to 12%, and service revenue will be in
the range of 4% to 6%.
From a bottom line perspective, we now expect an operating margin in the range of 31.8% to 32.2% versus 32% to 32.4% previously.
The guidance excludes any impact for the exceptional surtax applied by the French state, which we cannot exactly quantify at this
stage. However, it will be excluded from the non-IFRS reporting as it's an exceptional and temporary item for now.
Now I would like to share some additional points to help shape your models reflecting Q4. As mentioned, we are increasing our range
to EUR 120 million for revenue. The Q4 revenue translates to 5% at the low and 12% at the high end, or in absolute terms, to EUR
1.696 billion to EUR 1.860 billion. The new high end of the range was the midpoint of the previous guidance. Our pipeline reflects the
potential for revenue acceleration.
We adjusted the low end in 2 steps: first, to reflect the potential of large deals being pushed out to 2025. And second, the pipeline in
automotive convert into revenue at the same rate as it did in Q3.
The increased range is most visible in upfront license revenue of 0% to 20% growth. We expect subscription revenue in the range
of 12% to 19%, reflecting a strong acceleration driven by 3DEXPERIENCE deals. And in this outlook, we expect MEDIDATA to
continue to improve sequentially.
Operating margin is expected in the range of 35.9% to 36.9% and the EPS of EUR 0.38 to EUR 0.41, up between 5% to 13% ex FX,
with usual strong seasonality of Q4.
Now in conclusion, I want to reiterate our commitment to investing and support our long-term growth objectives, while expanding
our margins and delivering EPS costs. We continue to see strong customer demand and engagement across our 3DEXPERIENCE
portfolio, CENTRIC PLM and MEDIDATA. While we experienced the current volatility in some of our end markets, our pipeline
highlights the potential for growth acceleration.
Now Pascal and I are looking forward to your questions and the discussion. Thank you.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10Question and Answer
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
And we'll start with the questions from the room.
Balajee Tirupati
Citigroup Inc., Research Division
Balajee Tirupati from Citi. Two questions from my side, if I may. Firstly, if you could share more color on what your -- what outcome
you're factoring within the lower end and higher end of the fourth quarter outlook.
Second, at this point, when we are looking into 2025, if you can share any initial view on demand inflection expectation and as well as
growth expectation for the year.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
So you start with the first one, Rouven?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes. Thank you, Balajee, for the questions. On the low end, the situation is fairly straightforward. We experienced the volatility in the
automotive sector starting this second semester. And what we experienced in the third quarter is what we reflected also in the fourth
quarter in terms of the conversion of our pipeline of the automotive deals in the first quarter to be similar rate as we headed into the
third quarter.
The impact of this in the third quarter was about EUR 40 million, which also, when you look at our Q3 range, it's the delta between
the low and the high. So that impact has been factored in to lower the low end because the likelihood of the timing delays in the
automotive sector is still in Q4, as the case, and it's -- that's what has been reflected.
The second element is the large deals. We have a back-end loaded year. You remember when we met in Q2, the objective of Q2 was
to derisk the second half. Now as it -- as we see it at this point, Q3 was at the lower end of the range, so the trajectory is even more
back-end loaded coming into the end of the year. And we simply adjusted for that profile in our Q4 outcome.
We have large deals in our pipeline. The timing of advancing those deals to the end of the year can be less predictable. And in order to
be protected for that variability, we took the second step to further adjust the low end, which is the other half of the adjustment to the
low end, which is about EUR 100 million compared to the previous guidance.
So call it, 50% related to the auto sector, 50% related to the derisking of the large deals that we have in our pipeline that could come
into 2025. I think this gives you the elements of the construction of the guidance.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Related to 2025, I think it's a little bit early to speak about it. And from the management, I think we are clearly focused to deliver Q4
because it's not a light statement to say we will accelerate growth in Q4.
Now if you look at the trend, again, as I told you, the Aerospace & Defense is very resilient. And remember, many of our customers,
they have a lot of backlogs, and we need to accelerate the ramp-up of production. And this is really where we are playing a role, and
we are dragging the supply chain with it. So the trend is, in my view, very solid.
The auto sector, which is one we are discussing right now, I think we have been caught by surprise by the contraction of the volume.
But the deals are there. And remember, we are not the problem. We are the solutions to many of the problems they are facing right
now.
So as I was telling you in my introductory comments, I think this is creating forcing mechanisms to take decisions. And I can see it
on many fronts where there is for certain of them, no any more room to have fragmented information systems and the temptations toDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11standardize on one unique systems connecting design, manufacturing, test and having the backbone for the data is something which is
extremely important.
And we have several deals in the auto sectors where big win backs are at stakes. So the question for us is much more to qualify in
which quarter it will happen. This is the difficulty we are facing right now. However, the demand remain extremely solid, extremely
solid.
The consumer industry is going extremely well. You have seen it for several quarters. And it's not only CENTRIC PLM, it's really
everything we do in this space.
And last but not least, I think the starting of the year was a little bit soft for SOLIDWORKS, but we have seen an acceleration over the
time. And this is well reflected in the volume because we have some fluctuations coming from the transition to subscriptions moving
from license to subscription.
And a good way to measure the performance is to look at the volume. And from a volume standpoint, we are high single digits. And
this trend is really broad-based. It's not only one specific geo, which is driving the growth.
So if you combine all those elements, I think they are solid enough, to my view, contribute to the growth in 2025. And when we are
telling you the midpoint of the guidance for Q4 is 8, I think it's a good proxy to forecast what could be in 2025.
Mohammed Essaji Moawalla
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
This is Mohammed Moawalla, Goldman Sachs. Pascal and Rouven, there's obviously a lot of uncontrollables in terms of the end
market. You've talked about the pipeline. What is controllable from your standpoint in sort of driving that sort of acceleration of
growth into Q4 and next year?
Is it the way you kind of approach the customer with some of the big deals in terms of how you kind of construct them or break them
up to get that sort of momentum going because, obviously, the end markets are what they are?
And should we think about the range of outcomes? You talked about kind of the midpoint of Q4 as a proxy. Do you see as wide a
range of outcomes for next year in terms of where things could land or perhaps, that delta is a bit more closer?
And just one last thing on bookings growth at MEDIDATA and Life Sciences. Could you give us any kind of color on that in terms of
the kind of quantum of the improvement you're seeing?
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Rouven, I'll take the first one and you're going to take the booking, yes.
It's a good question. My easiest answer is really the transactional part is really the one we are controlling the most. And if you look
at who are the key product line contributing to the transactional part, on one hand, it's SOLIDWORKS. It is extremely transactional.
And on the other hand, it's MEDIDATA because MEDIDATA, you remember, it's based on the volume of studies, so it's more
transactional than transformational.
The two engine, one is recovering, and we are back to growth, and Rouven will give some proxy for this. And the SOLIDWORKS
trend is really sustainable and good. So that's the reason why I think this is giving the foundations to at least have a minimum of
contribution on the top line.
Then after you have the large transactions, and the last transactions, for sure, I do not want to place the price. It would have been easy
for us to compromise on certain of the big transaction we have in order to maybe create the triggering event, if you want, to close in a
given quarter.
But we learned something from the previous crisis is when it's tough, you need to protect your value. That's what we do. And believe
me, Rouven and I, we are not compromising on the value that we would do, despite the fact that the competition on many fronts is
playing this card.
So why we do this? It's because we are convinced about the value we are providing. We are convinced about the unique differentiation
we have. And then after if we are not signing in a given quarter, we will sign it 1 or 2 quarters after. So I would prefer to play this
game rather than to pay the price elasticity.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes. And just to add to this, Pascal, before I go to the MEDIDATA part. This is also reflected in the increasing range, to have that
level of flexibility in terms of timing that we need in order to preserve the value at the right time, at the right moment.
For MEDIDATA, to give you some additional color in terms of the bookings and the cost potential, we are going to -- over the next 2
to 3 quarters, we'll have significant renewals. So we will see the bookings growth increasing of multiyear existing clients.
But there, and we are quite confident they will not just renew at par, they will renew with cost. So there's always been a catalyst of our
business is to expand. And given we will be able to capitalize on the innovation that we introduced to the market next -- last year at
next, and this coming next will be another inflection point for the next cycle.
Overall, the market for the clinical trial starts stabilizing, even though it's a small absolute volumes, but it is stabilizing. The trend is
positive. We will continue to win market share. This quarter for MEDIDATA was flattish cost. And our expectation is to be back to
growth in Q4.
And then for 2025, I think we discussed that. There's no change to the trajectory that we have set for '25 and '26. So it's the progressive
recovery with all the elements, including the renewals.

Michael Briest, UBS. Rouven, just looking at the guidance, there's about EUR 100-odd million on the revenues there. Only EUR 20
million on profit given this is high-margin license business or subscription deals. Can you talk about what the flex is in the cost that
keeps the margin range so tight?
And then just on CENTRIC PLM, could you just say how strong that was in the quarter given the mainstream innovation growth was
15% and SOLIDWORKS was mid-single? Maybe the size of that business, just remind us on that.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Okay. Thanks, Michael. Thanks for asking for more numbers. Well, the -- when you compare '23 with '24, in '23, the growth in OpEx
was 9%. The year-to-date growth of OpEx is 6%. So it's a reduction of about 1/3 of the growth.
How did we do that? Twofold. First, we were controlling the headcount growth. It's -- the headcount growth is less than 50% of last
year's growth, that's around 40%. And also the shift between young graduates and most senior hires is much more favoring young
graduates. For example, in Q3, the majority of the increase was related to young graduates and interns that started in the company
following their internships.
So we've been really focusing on this. We have been growing. About 1/3 of the growth is in our development center in Pune, which
is going extremely well. So we have managed to reduce -- the payroll cost is more than 2/3, it's 3/4 of our expenses. That's where the
optimization is coming from.
At the same point in time, we are investing more into cloud and infrastructure. That's going up, so we have two effects, one which is
going down, one which is growing. And the net of it is a 6% growth, which we plan to stabilize also for 2025.
In the new outlook, at the top line, we'll discuss then in 2025. But between 5% to 6% OpEx cost, it has inherited a level of
productivity in order to be able to reinvest at a much higher level. That's only the net, but the gross of expense growth, net of the
productivity is much, much higher. So this gives you the main point.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
About Centric, Rouven was qualifying this an outstanding performance. I can give you the percentage, it is 90% growth for this
quarter. So since the beginning of the year, the growth is exceeding 50%.
So you remember a few times ago, I was telling you, we are building the roadmap for Centric to become a EUR 1 billion brand. And
we are already on this track. The market is large enough. If you remember, when we made the acquisition, the software revenue wasDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 13around EUR 70 million. Now we are exceeding by far EUR 200 million. So the next goal is the EUR 0.5 billion. That's what we are
building.
And you have seen not only we are diversifying from an industry standpoint. It's not only more fashion and apparel. It's also food and
beverage. It's also consumer electronics. But we are also expanding from a solution standpoint.
We started from the collection management. And more and more, we're expanding to -- with the planning, the supply chain
optimization, the business analytics. And you should consider Centric being the business platform for the consumer industry.
And we are winning a lot of market share, which I think it's also an interesting data point for you. You have seen third quarter, we
are gaining at minimum between 25 to 30 new logo. And now we start to have the renewal because the first deal we signed was for,
some of them 3, 4 years ago. And when we are renewing, just because we are expanding the scope in terms of solution, we are also not
renewing at par. We are increasing the spending.
So very confident with Centric. I think we are glad we made this diversification a few years ago. And this is driving against not only
the Centric business, but the rest of what we do. Because if you remember, the most difficult is always to find a way to enter into the
space. As soon as you are in, you have the ability to expand on multiple fronts. For example, in food and beverage, the manufacturing
topic is becoming also hot, and we discovered that the solution we have are extremely relevant for this market as well.
Adam Dennis Wood
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Adam Wood from Morgan Stanley. Sorry, just to come back on the guidance for the fourth quarter. But just on the low end, if I
remember correctly, at the second quarter, you suggested that the low end already didn't have any big deals in the assumption. So is it
more of the volume business because of the auto space has become weaker? Could you give us a little bit of clarification of what was
assumed in Q2 and then what's come down versus that?
And then secondly, Pascal, the GenAI topic is obviously incredibly interesting. Could you just talk a little bit about how you're
engaging with customers on that, what the appetite is and the monetization?
And maybe more importantly, I had understood in the past that what would be generated by computers often in design would be very
difficult to do with the reductive manufacturing, and so it needed to be more additive, which is more complex.
I guess, when you're doing generative shopfloor, the shopfloor that's generated is quite difficult for companies to get to because it's
actually quite difficult to change brownfield environments.
How do you manage that change process with customers? And how do you get things -- and is there a need to actually structurally
change how these shopfloors are constructed from a hardware and software point of view to be able to take advantage of what's being
done in GenAI to get to that optimized shopfloor of the future?
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Thank you, Adam. I'll happily take the first one. You're right, for Q2, we made an adjustment related to the mega deals that we
excluded from the guidance following the update in Q2 and Q3. And mega deals, I categorize EUR 15 million plus.
If I look at the Q3 adjustment, we also -- given the back-end loaded profile following the Q3 results, we need to look at this again and
also take a look at the -- a more derisked look at the EUR 5 million to EUR 10 million sized deals to derisk them.
So I would characterize the difference between Q2 and Q3, it's a further step in reflecting a 5% growth in Q4 as a low, low scenario
with good visibility to the midpoint of 8%. But the range of the pipeline is really covering from 8 -- from 5% to 12%, all the way to
the high end if we can land some of those larger deals. So this is really the second step that was necessary. Thank you, Adam.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Related to AI, there are a few things. Point #1, the most important point you should remember is this is helping us to legitimate the
platform as a data-centric platform.
If you survey our installed base, you still have a large fraction, which consider the 3DEXPERIENCE platform to be only model-based
and to be relevant for the life cycle management. They are forgetting that the platform has been designed to be data-centric since dayDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 141. So AI coming, this is drawing the attention of our customers that they can do a lot with the existing platform they already have in
their hands. That's point #1.
Point #2, you know that our platform is managing the knowledge and the know-how. And if you look at the company we serve, you
still have a collection of knowledge and know-how being prisoner of the documents. And the AI technology is a fantastic technology
to extract from documents the knowledge and the know-how and to combine it with the models.
Let me give you an example. If you take the requirements, most of them are in written form. At best, you are using a specialized
software, but it's still a document. If you could extract those information from the document and generate a model, what could you do?
You can start to stimulate, for example, the requirements. Concrete case of what I'm saying. If you take the auto sector, especially the
new EVs, you have so much regulations coming every month that this industry have a hard time to follow if they are compliant or not.
Having this ability to read automatically the regulations, translate it into models, doing simulations, checking the compliancy with it,
it's something which has extreme -- which is really valuable for them. This is the second point, moving from document to model.
The third point is, as you may know, what we do is extremely sophisticated, and the democratization is something extremely
important. So AI, and especially with the Copilot approach, it's a way to give advanced functions into nonexperts' hands. And this is a
way for us to enlarge our footprints in many, many customers and in many, many industries.
So the combination of those two elements, this is, Adam, how we are leveraging the AI trends right now and how we are engaged with
customers. We can go far beyond this. But as many of you wrote, because I was reading your piece of research, the vast majority of
the money is still spent on the infrastructure right now for AI.
And we need to have the infrastructure in place to start to see the shift moving from the infrastructure to the application and to the
generative services on top of it. And we are ready for this. The portfolio is built. You are seeing the collections.
We can leverage what we have been as a legacy in terms of datasets for the last 40 years. And this will definitely have an additional, I
think, percentage of growth in the coming years.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will now take the first question from the phone from the line of Fred Boulan from Bank of America.
Frederic Emile Alfred Boulan
BofA Securities, Research Division
First of all, on MEDIDATA, you mentioned that there's no change in your trajectory set for '25 and '26 of a progressive recovery. It
would be good to get a bit more meat and detail beyond the -- that expectation, if you can be a bit more specific on what that means.
And then secondly, if you can spend a moment on free cash flow conversion and guidance. I think your previous guidance or
indication was for free cash flow to full your EBIT growth. If you can be -- if you can kind of quantify what you expect for this year
and maybe next in terms of growth or conversion.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Yes. Thank you, Fred. MEDIDATA, the progressive recovery for '25, '26, we are -- in 2025, we -- our objective is to end the year
of 2025 with a backlog growth of double-digit entering into 2026, which will set us up for double-digit growth in 2026. That's the
progressive recovery on which we are on.
It's supported by the stabilization of the market environment and the expansions that we are bringing to the market to our existing
customers. So it's very consistent with our messaging. And I think the third quarter starting into the second semester of 2024 was a
starting point on this journey.
Now to the cash flow, our operating cash flow was up 6% year-to-date at the conversion, very aligned with the operating income.
Now what do we expect for the rest of the year? You have to reflect the back-end loaded nature of the year where large deals that
potentially close in December, they won't have a cash impact on 2024. So we estimate that this to have an impact of around 3 points
on the operating cash flow growth if I compare that to our year-to-date growth. Right now, we're up at 6%.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15The operating income is largely flat year-over-year, non-IFRS. So I expect an operating cash flow to be low to mid-single-digit growth
for 2024. Now it's a timing effect because those deals when we close will then drive cash flow in the quarters to follow, and so there
should be a catch-up effect in 2025.
So that's -- these are the elements, right? So there is an element of the back-end loaded year that has an impact on the Q4 growth
of operating cash flow compared to last year where, remember, Q3 was strong, and it had a good impact on our Q4 cash flow
performance, which we will not have to that extend into -- this year in 2024.
Operator
We will now take the next question from the line of Toby Ogg from JPMorgan.
Toby Ogg
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Just wanted to double deck just on MEDIDATA. I know Life Science's growth was 0%, but just wanted to double check what exactly
MEDIDATA growth was and just whether it was still negative.
And then just on the gross margin. It looks like the gross margins have started to fall year-over-year over the past 2 quarters. This
quarter was down 150 bps year-over-year. So just wondering if you could unpack the drivers of the gross margin and how we should
be thinking about the gross margin going forward.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Well, thanks, Toby. So MEDIDATA performance was flattish, call it, minus 1% to 0% in that range. For the gross margin, it's very
aligned with the operating margin, which is down also year-over-year due to the lower revenue contribution year-to-date total revenue
at 4%, cost growing at 6%. That's essentially the element.
Operator
We will now take the next question from the line of Laurent Daure from Kepler Cheuvreux.
Laurent Daure
Kepler Cheuvreux, Research Division
I have two questions. The first is if you could take a deeper dive in the auto sector, giving us a bit more granularity on your positioning
in Asia in terms of market share in the auto sector versus what you have in Europe, maybe the revenue per customer.
And more generally, if you position yourself 3, 5 years from now, with the hypothesis that, potentially, the auto European industry
would collapse and replaced partially by the Asian OEM, what could be the impact on your revenues? So that's the first one.
The second one is easier. There's a lot of talks about M&A in the space, Bentley, Altair. How do you position yourself? And how is
your pipeline looking on the M&A deals?
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
All right. I will answer, and feel free to add whatever you want, Rouven.
Related to the auto sector, I think, remember, you have to look at, Asian is not only one single market. So traditionally, we have a
strong presence in Japan with Toyota and Honda. Also Nissan, but Nissan more on the manufacturing than on the engineering side,
right, where we are the de facto standard.
If you look at Korea, I think we have most of the key players, HKMC, for sure, Mitsubishi as well. So -- and then after, you have
the Chinese players. We entered into China in the auto sector more than a decade ago, starting by first the JVs that the large players
needed. And that's the reason why in -- for most of the one who started more than a decade ago, CATIA V5 and ENOVIA is the de
facto standard. And for all the newcomers, the one who started directly with the EV approach, I told you last time that more than 85%
of them are standardized on 3DEXPERIENCE.
So why I'm saying this is because on the long run, this is giving to me a certain confidence that the auto sector will still represent a
significant market for Dassault Systèmes, even if the competitiveness could shift from Europe to Asia on a certain front.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16The second topic, which is related to M&A, yes, you're right. You have many, many activities or discussions going on. You have seen
this morning Siemens declaring to be in discussion with Altair. Why I'm saying this? Because for many names you just mentioned,
they would have been relevant 10 years ago when we never -- when we didn't have the platform, when we didn't have basically
structured the company the same way.
Now spending more than EUR 10 billion, if not EUR 20 billion, for something which is just enlarging what we do, but not
transforming what we do, I think there is no path to create values. And that's the reason why, believe me or not, we are looking the
M&A in a very different manner compared to the movements which are happening right now.
The key point -- and remember, 20 years ago, the M&A was instrumental for us to build the product lines. This is how we have built
the brands portfolios, and this is how we are expanding the scope. The last decade, the M&A was instrumental for us to diversify the
industry, and this is how we came with the 3 sectors of the economies.
In the next 10 years, the M&A will be a lever for us to realize what we want to do, which is this V+R. We want to connect the virtual
with the real. And by the way, this is our time lines, virtual world for real life.
So if you want to understand our way and our framework, you should think along this way. The point for us has come the time to
connect both, and this is the reason why the M&A could be used as a lever to accelerate this transformation of Dassault Systèmes on
the long run.
But coming back to your questions, I think there is limited value for us to spend billions for something we are already doing, even if
it's sometimes partially, because that's not the way we are building our policy.
The M&A has always been a way to create the new positioning of the company, to do what we want to do and not to complement the
missing piece to realize the plan. I know it's probably not answering to -- fully to your questions, but I'm giving to you the glasses you
should wear in order to understand our thinking process.
Laurent Daure
Kepler Cheuvreux, Research Division
Pascal, maybe just to clarify. The last point is on -- when you take your biggest Chinese EV clients, if you position yourself, let's
say, 5, 6 years from now, do you believe some of them could be in size relatively close to what you generate with historic clients like
Honda or Stellantis?
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Of course. And Laurent, for some of them, it's already the case.
Operator
We will now take the next question from the line of Nicolas David from ODDO BHF.
Nicolas David
ODDO BHF Corporate & Markets, Research Division
Yes. The first one is, sorry to come back on the automotive sector, but could you please share a bit more elements regarding the
discussion you're having right now with those clients notably on the large or mega deals you have in the pipeline? Do you have the
feeling that is really just -- those delays are really just linked to those clients having the need to reduce their budget and not having
enough visibility to sign right now or the situation can inform them to rethink more broadly their approach on this kind of big contract,
even, yes, from a scope or a technological standpoint?
And still on the automotive sector. Given that some clients are willing to streamline the number of programs they have, do you see
also a risk on more of your current installed base of support revenue you have at some OEMs?
And the second question is a follow-up from Toby, one on the gross margin. We saw a decline on software gross margin. So if I
understand well, your answer, Rouven, it's linked to lower growth directly. And if so, could you help us understand why this lower
revenue growth has an impact on the gross margin rate? Or do you see something else like a move to cloud? It would be helpful.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & DirectorDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 17So the purchasing behavior in the auto sector is the following. As you say, they are -- the industry has been caught by surprise in the
summertime by the significant slowdown on the EV cell. And as you may know, many of them, they have invested a lot not only to
develop the car, but to build the new production systems.
So why I'm saying this? It's because it's normal reactions for the next 6 following months. They will almost stop their investments in
order to decide the right level of priorities. And we are in this phase, whereby the goal for us is always being the same, is to position
what we do in the high-end priorities for all the customers we are discussing with.
This is really what is happening. I think we are doing, and to echo most questions, what is in our hands. What is in our hands is to do
the conviction path on we are the solutions, not the problems. And we are ready, and we have everything you need.
What we are not controlling is how long they need to make their mind about what is the level of priorities for them for the coming
months, quarters and years. But do what we know is usually this period is 6 months max.
The budget discussion, which is really happening right now in many companies for 2025, is giving to us the window at least to discuss
it and to position our value proposal and to act. This is giving at least the compelling reasons if you want to position ourselves.
The second question was related to...
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes. What are some of the programs...
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Yes, yes, yes. the programs. So this is an interesting thing. Remember,that most of the programs are sharing common pieces. And if
you stop, then you need to understand the consequences on the program you want to maintain.
Why I'm saying this is because our system is extremely helpful in this environment. I remember the time when Carlos Tavares took
the management position at PSA. And the first thing he did was rationalizing all the car programs. That was the best moment for
Dassault Systèmes at PSA because the management was blind, they were cutting, and they had no clue about the dependency between
the programs themselves. And they realized that some of the common pieces was supposed to be developed by this program and
irrigating all the others.
So the system we are developing for the car companies is really giving this ability to manage and to take the right decisions, taking
into account all the interdependency between all the programs themselves.
So I will not say it's a good thing, but it's not a bad thing because this is a way to legitimate again the platform. This is a way to
legitimate the life cycle management capabilities we have, and this is the way to legitimate all the analytics we have developed on top
of it.
Remember, the platform is really used now as a business platform by many companies. You remember, I was mentioning Renault,
who was doing all the pricing and the cost analysis using the platform. It's not something they do with an ERP system. They do it with
the 3DEXPERIENCE platform right now.
So the nature of what we do is large enough to take the benefit of the situations as soon as the people are ready to spend. And this is
the point I was mentioning previously.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes. And to the gross margin, Nicolas, to come back, it's really related to the lower revenue. That has exposed us with 4% revenue
growth. It has an impact on the gross margin until we accelerate that.
Operator
We will now take the next question from the line of Ben Castillo-Bernaus from BNP Paribas.
Ben Castillo-Bernaus
BNP Paribas Exane, Research DivisionDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 18Just a question on the cash conversion. So looks like Q3 was down about 600 basis points over last year. Just what drove that? And
then the second point on if the full year operating cash flow is going to be growing low to mid-single digit, I think that implies Q4, the
cash conversion deteriorates again.
Given that there's less large deals in H2 than last year, are we going to be seeing that cash conversion improve year-over-year? And I
had a follow-up on tax, if that's okay.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Yes. So on the cash flow for the third quarter or year-to-date, the main part you see for the third quarter, the reduction in contract
liabilities, that had an impact on the operating cash flow compared to last year. There was a stronger decrease in contract liabilities this
quarter than last year at the same time.
And this really had the impact on the lower conversion in Q3. While year-to-date, the conversion is still good, and we are benefiting
here also from lower tax payments that were very elevated last year in the nonoperating working capital.
So this gives you the elements why is it there's a stronger decrease. It's a result of some of the deals have moved into the end of the
year. So it's business activity related and timing related.
And also please keep -- take note that the DSOs, the days of sales outstanding, is stable year-over-year at 85 days. For the Q4, yes,
for the Q4, we have the back-end loaded year, as I mentioned before. That has an impact on the operating cash flow, which I outlined
before, about 3 points versus the year-to-date number. And again, it's timing related. DSOs are stable, and collections remain pretty
stable, too. And I expect it also to improve much on these versus Q3. It really depends on the timing of closing that not only has an
impact on the revenue, but also on the cash flow.
Now you wanted to ask a question on tax. Maybe we can slot that in at the end.
Ben Castillo-Bernaus
BNP Paribas Exane, Research Division
Yes, yes. So that's great. Just year-to-date tax is about 200 basis points less than last year. So I just wondered how much of that is
sustainable into 2025. Or are these kind of temporary tax liabilities or provisions you're taking advantage of this year?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes. So for tax, we are slightly -- we are lower by, you're right, 200 basis points versus last year, which takes into account some of the
audits that we successfully completed and, as a result, adjusted some of our provisions and risk in our tax rate that had been reflected
already at the end of Q2 and is consistent between Q2 and Q3.
And for the rest of the year, I know there was also a question, and I might address that implicitly through your question, the impact on
the tax rate -- reduction of the tax rate on the full year outlook for EPS, the -- while it's -- the tax rate for the full year is now about 0.5
point lower than what it was in the initial guidance.
And keep in mind, that 0.5 point, the tax rate translates to about EUR 0.01 on the full year EPS. So it really has a marginal impact on
the EPS compared to the guidance adjustment. The impact really comes from the lower revenue and is offset by 2/3 -- by the lower
OpEx. And then improved financial income, plus the slightly adjusted tax rate makes the rest to keep the EPS in the range of EUR
1.27 to EUR 1.30.
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
And with that, we'll close the call for this morning. Thank you.
Pascal Daloz

Thank you very much. Again, we remain confident for Q4 and for the acceleration. The pipeline is there, and the management is really
focused on this. Hope to see you on the road. And I know, Rouven, you are planning to do some road show.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 4Presentation
Beatrix Martinez
Vice President of Investor Relations
Good morning, everyone. I'm Beatrix Martinez, Dassault Systèmes VP, Investor Relations. And from the company, we have Pascal
Daloz, CEO; and Rouven Bergmann, CFO. I would like to welcome you to Dassault Systèmes Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024
Presentation.
At the end of the presentation, we will take questions from participants first in the room and then online. Later today, we will also hold
a conference call.
Dassault Systèmes results are prepared in accordance with IFRS. Most of the financial figures in this conference call are presented on
a non-IFRS basis, with revenue growth rates in constant currencies, unless otherwise noted. For an understanding of the differences
between the IFRS and the non-IFRS, please see the reconciliation tables included in our press release.
Some of the comments we will make during today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements, which could differ
materially from actual results. Please refer to our risk factors in our 2023 Document d’enregistrement universel published on March
18th.
And I will now hand over to Pascal Daloz.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Thank you, Beatrix. Good morning to all of you. It's always a pleasure to be with you at this time of the year, for the one being here or
for the one being connected.
Let me start by giving the tone for Q4. I think we are extremely pleased with our performance and the strong commercial momentum
this quarter. You have seen we signed major contract driven by the 3DEXPERIENCE, which will accelerate the future growth.
Now let's start with some few headlines figure for our Q4 and for the full year 2024 results. I think we delivered a strong Q4 result
with the most important thing, which is the software revenue accelerating to 9%. And this top line momentum was driven by a 13%
increase in our new businesses and a 22% rise in 3DEXPERIENCE. EPS grew by 11%, which I think is also a good thing.
Before I hand over it to Rouven for the detail on our financials and the 2025 outlook, I want to touch on 3 important topics. First,
2024 has been a year of the competitive success, driven by the expansion of the 3DEXPERIENCE across industries, domain and
geographies and redefining in deep the strategic relationship we have with many industry leaders. And I will share some names with
you later on.
Second, I think key to this success is the relevance of the 3DEXPERIENCE, which is now contributing to nearly 40% of the software
revenue. And I think by combining the deep industry knowledge and know-how, it really helps our customers to enhance their value
proposal and empower their team, which is probably the most important. And all of this, this will nurture our future growth and build
the foundation for the broad adoption of the cloud.
The third element, I think, today, we are unveiling a major horizon for Dassault Systèmes, one that has been built not only over the
work over the last 3 years to define, create the game-changing solutions based on the deep and wide adoption of generative AI. But
also, you will see it on the positioning of our companies. And this solution will enable our clients across all the sectors to take the
advantage of artificial intelligence at every stage of the life cycle of the product and the services.
Now let's start with some key comments on the sectors, on the trends and the key wins. In the manufacturing industry, the automotive
sector faced, as you know, slowing demand, mostly driven by the EV adoption rates. And the automakers are under increasing
pressure to transform themselves, but also becoming more innovative and more efficient at the same time.
To achieve this, they really need to develop software-defined vehicles on one hand, while also they need to become much more cost
effective as most of the vehicles are currently too expensive. So this is why they are turning to 3DEXPERIENCE.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 04, 2025

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 5And if you look at basically the sequence of events for the last 18 months, we have displaced the competition on many occasions. We
significantly expanded our footprint, while, despite the competitive environment, we have been able to preserve the value of what we
do.
Just for you, a quick reminder. Remember, you remember Jaguar Land Rover in 2020 -- end of '22 -- '23, sorry. In 2024, we did
BMW. Early this year, Volvo, Mahindra & Mahindra. And I'm really proud to announce that the Volkswagen Group has also chosen
to adapt to the 3DEXPERIENCE at large.
I think beyond these win backs, the industry continue really to offer substantial growth opportunity within the supply chain, which is
still untapped by expanding the deployment of our existing customers.
In the meanwhile, I think the aerospace industry is facing a paradox. The order backlog are achieving the record level, but the supply
chain disruptions and the production ramp-up challenges make this transformation even more critical to collect the cash. And that's
the reason why the aerospace OEM rely on our 3DEXPERIENCE to meet demands, accelerate the production, optimize the cash flow,
streamline their supply chain.
And in 2024, we redefined a 20-year partnership with Airbus by expanding into their value network. And more importantly, also, we
are expanding in the U.S. Defense sector with a significant contract with Lockheed Martin Group, which I will also discuss more in
detail after.
Looking ahead, I think we have significant growth opportunity, particularly in space and defense, with the U.S. being the critical
market for this expansion.
In the consumer-driven industry, I think the PLM adoption is still at the early stage. I think it is creating a strong dynamic, and we
have seen it with Centric PLM, you know our dedicated brand for this sector, which are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this
momentum. And I think our solution is really fitting perfectly for the needs for these markets. And I think the addressable market
remains vast.
Now turning to Life Sciences. We announced a very important thing, which is a strategic repositioning of Dassault Systèmes and
specifically MEDIDATA, and we did at NEXT. NEXT was the event we had in November, and some of you have the pleasure to
participate to this event.
So this repositioning include an expansion of the value proposal of MEDIDATA, which is now been on 3 pillars, the patient
experience on one hand; the data experience on the other hand; and the 3DEXPERIENCE. And I think it has been extremely well
received notably by the large pharma. And as an evidence of what I'm saying is all the renewal and expansion of the major contract we
have achieved in 2024.
I think now we are leveraging our expanding portfolio with clients such as BMS, Sanofi, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Regeneron,
Novotech, and Bayer, which I will come back also on this.
Additionally, I think we have signed several win backs, displacing again the competition, including a strategic EDC Agreement with
Eli Lilly. And as you know, it's one of the competitor flagships customer.
I think this repositioning in Life Sciences include also the expansion into manufacturing and PLM, the integration of artificial
intelligence across the entire portfolio, the development of the virtual twin as a way to connect the practitioners with the patients and
also the combination of the real drug with software to enable a personalized treatment.
I think, consequently, we are pretty confident on our ability to return progressively to the digital growth. And I think this will
strengthen our position in Life Science with the ongoing innovations we have across the portfolio.
In Infrastructure & Cities, the energy transition is driving a strong demand across all the renewals and the nuclear. I think this is
fueling clearly our momentum into this sector.
In Construction, the focus is really on enhancing the productivity, minimizing the material waste, renovating existing buildings and
reducing the CO2 emissions. This segmenting industry start from the hospital to the nuclear plant to the data centers is really a deep
expertise. And this is where we focus on the key segments using the 3DEXPERIENCE and the virtual twin as a way to integrate the
knowledge and the know-how and enable more regenerative approach.
In addition, I think with one single platform, not only this platform is used for the engineering phase, but also more and more for the
RUD, which is really unique on the market.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 04, 2025

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 6So I want you to keep in mind something, which is in the Infrastructure sector, more than the market share, I think what's important
for us is the share of value because we focus on transformative projects that make the real impacts where we bring the disruptive
approach to drive the lasting changes.
Now I think it's -- let's explore in detail some of these customer cases. As I mentioned, Volkswagen Group has selected
3DEXPERIENCE platform on the cloud. And I think it's a decision, which encompass all the group's brands, including obviously
Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche, but also Skoda, Seat, CUPRA, Bentley, Lamborghini, Scania, just I will not name all of them. So it's
really the entire group.
Why this is important? Because it's usually once in 20 years decisions, and you cannot miss the window. And I think it was a 2-years
battle, and we concluded successfully this negotiation. You know Volkswagen, they are facing a lot of challenges and why they are
selecting us is because they are counting on us to accelerate and to support their transformations.
At the end, we are talking about 40,000 users relying on the platform, while expanding the scope of the partnership far beyond the
mechanical engineering, to system engineering, to manufacturing with hundreds of Volkswagen Group factories involved. And this
extension of the scope imply, obviously, a displacing of the competition, and I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.
With 3DEXPERIENCE platform, I think Volkswagen is also benefiting from faster development cycle, which is the topic for many
European players, how to reduce the cycle time almost by 2, divided by 2, to be around 20 months. It's also a way to optimize the
resource allocations and to shorter the time to market.
So the choice was driven also on the fact that we have a cloud solutions. And the cloud solution is really a way for them to accelerate
the adoptions, but more importantly, it's related to the foundation for artificial intelligence. And I think we are strongly supporting
Volkswagen in this radical transformation, moving from the traditional car manufacturing to the software-driven innovation.
After Volkswagen, another major win, Lockheed Martin Group. And again, this decision also encompasses all the group divisions,
including the aircraft, the space systems and the helicopter.
This group, like many, they face surging defense demands, and they must accelerate their productions. And as a long-time partner,
they are committed to expanding their commitment by expanding the use of the 3DEXPERIENCE platform to transform the
manufacturing operations. This is really where it's a big expansion for us.
And again, in this case, we are displacing the competition. The key topic is the 3DEXPERIENCE platform for manufacturing will
streamline the production, connect the suppliers and the shop floor for a rigorous quality control, and it will take a step further.
Now I think Lockheed Martin is also doing something which is unique. They are becoming a model-based enterprise. What does it
mean? It means they have fully integrated the digital threat across the entire product's life cycle. And in that world, they are creating
the virtual twin, if you want, of the company, of the enterprise to manage the transformation and to have a greater agility.
Now moving to the Life Sciences, I mentioned Bayer. Bayer is a longstanding partner. We have a 90-years relationship with them, and
they are clearly a key strategic partner for the clinical research.
As part of their growth strategy, they explored many, many other solutions, as you could imagine. But they realize, none of them
could meet their higher standards. So I think with this renewal and expansion, Bayer is not only accelerating in this clinical trial, both
by increasing the volume of studies conducted with us, but also by expanding the use of our portfolio.
They are preparing for the future with Rave Lite, the new solution we introduced 2 quarters ago to tackle the early Phase 2Ds. And
they are also expanding the use of the Patient Cloud to make easier for the patient to participate remotely in the clinical trial. For me,
this is not only just a contract renewal. It's a clear acknowledgment of the superiority of our MEDIDATA platform.
To conclude with customer wins, BIAD has chosen also the 3DEXPERIENCE platform to transform the hospital construction. And
why they do this is because they are leveraging the virtual twin and simulation at the same times to enhance the patient care, to reduce
the wait time and to optimize the operations. Almost like a manufacturing plant will do, except it's a hospital.
At the end, they are reusing massively the knowledge, to increase the productivity, and they share with us some results. They are
improving the productivity by 30%, and they're cutting the cost by 15%.
With our productization, I think BIAD is setting a new standard in the quality and efficiency. Just for you to know, the first virtual
hospital twin has been developed and completed in 90 days. And we have 19 other just only in the Beijing regions to do. So clearly,
it's only the starting point.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 04, 2025

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7This is really how we drive the innovation in a specialized construction market by being extremely verticalized and against combining
the platform with the virtual twin.
On a final note, on the construction market, I want to draw your attention on the fact that China accounts for the 25% of the global
construction market. And to accelerate our market penetration, we launched and we are launching, in fact, a new joint venture for
sustainable cities and buildings in China with CSADI.
And CSADI is one of the largest leading architecture and engineering institutes, employing over 5,000 engineers. And for the one who
have a lot of interest for this sector, they just published a complete scientific analysis in a very well-known review, which is nature,
and you have the link in the chart.
Why this is important? Because they are again making the demonstration that combining the 3DEXPERIENCE with the virtual twins,
they are capable to reduce the construction time by 25%, to reduce the cost by 10%, the waste by 15% and improve the quality by
nearly 20%. So that's what is about.
Now let's move to the other big announcement, which is the Generation 7. So -- and I want you to give you some framework for you
to think about it. If you remember, just 1 year ago, we announced our 2040 horizons, and we call it the generative economy.
And if you remember, the generative economy is the convergence of what we used to call the experience economy, where the product
is not enough. And you need an experience on top of it with a circular economy, with the necessity to have the circularity across all
the different players.
The way we came to this is because we took inspiration from the living world. The living world, they generate more than they
consume. And I think this is the paradigm for the future. And for our customers, the generative economy provide tremendous
opportunity when it comes to creating sustainable products and services, to reinvent the circular way of life, to provide accessible of
quality care for all, for example.
But at the end, the generative economy is the knowledge economy. And what does it mean? It means it's an economy where the virtual
assets, which is the intellectual property, will serve as a new currency. And that is extremely important for you to keep this in mind.
And the reason is because the leaders of tomorrow will be really the one who are the best to develop their knowledge and the know-
how assets.
And as a consequence, today, as part of the generative economy, we are introducing what we call the Generation 7, and we have a
name for this. This is called the 3D UNIV+RSES. And the 3D UNIV+RSES is an alternative to the metaverse or the omniverse. It's a
way for us to connect the virtual and the real and to build the foundation for all the related AI-based services.
Why I want to take some time for you to understand this? The 3D UNIV+RSES is a new way or a new class of representation of the
world. And you know that it's our obsession in the foundation of the company to invent the industry-changing representation of the
world.
So these 3D UNIV+RSES are really the seventh generation of representations we have introduced over the last 40 years. And why this
is important? Because it's always allowing new way of imagining, creating and producing things.
Let me do a quick recap. With the Gen 1 in the '80s, we introduced a 3D modeling. And this 3D modeling was really a way to do
the digital preassembly. When you have to manipulate a lot of parts and to create an assembly, it's much easier if you have the 3D
modeling to do this.
The Generation 2 was related about the digital markup, right? And you remember, it's the 777. How could you have virtual objects,
which is extremely valuable if you have to do design in context? And if you remember, on this airplane, you have more than 10,000
people working at the same time.
The Generation 3 of the representation of the world was the PDM. How it to couple the information with the representations?
Specifically for the collaborations through the project and the program management in engineering and manufacturing domains.
The Generation 4 was related to the PLM of the life cycle because when you do such an object, you need to trace, you need to certify,
you need to life cycle, you need to be able to maintain them when they are in operations. And this is what the PLM -- the product life
cycle management is about.
The Generation 7, we introduced the virtual twin concept. The virtual twin is much more than a replica of the physical product. It's an
elevation is how you combine the virtual representation with the physical representations in one single thing.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 04, 2025
Copyright © 2025 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8And the Generation 6 was about the virtual twin experience. And you remember, it's when we make this shift for moving to things to
life, making the biology as integrating part of the virtual twins. At the end, this is us creating a lot of IP for our customers.
And you remember, we have the largest customer base. So clearly, at the end, we have been able to create for the last 40 years the
largest knowledge base.
So the question is, how to leverage this knowledge base? And this is what the universe is about. The universe, this 3D UNIV+RSES
is really a combination of the modeling and simulations with the real world evidence on one hand and the artificial intelligence
generative content on the other hand.
They embed multiple generative artificial intelligence technology at the core of our 3DEXPERIENCE platform. They will allow our
customers to fully explore their rich, high-quality patrimony of 3D design, virtual twins and PLM's data.
And with the 3D UNIV+RSES, I think we offer a unique and secure industry environment to do several things, to combine and cross
simulating the virtual twins. So for example, to combine the virtual twin of the car with the virtual twin of the manufacturing plant and
the car when it's in use.
But also more importantly, for the training of the multi-AI engine, which is the big topic right now, especially for the industrial
data. The vast majority of the AI engine has been developed for the web, for the consumer data. But when we are talking about
industrial data, it's another thing because you need to protect the intellectual property at the same time. So you need to provide a safe
environment for the customers.
As a consequence, I think we are introducing new AI base services. First is what we call the generative experiences is experiences,
which has been created not by human but by artificial intelligence. We are also introducing what we call the virtual companions. As
you may know, the portfolio of solutions we have is composed by roles, processes and solutions. So in addition to this, we will have
the virtual companions to help the people in their roles.
And more importantly, I think we also are coming with what we call the virtual twin as a service, which my view is the future of the
professional services. Many of the professional services are right now writing codes to connect the different systems together. With
the cloud coming and with artificial intelligence generating automatically the code to do the connection between the systems, I think
this is important to rethink what the professional services is about. And this idea to create a virtual twin on behalf of our customers is
probably enough reasons for them.
Now let me give you an industry view of the 3D UNIV+RSES. In each of the 3 sectors of the economy, we are focusing on the new
value areas centered around what we call the end products or end services, which is at the core what created by our customers for their
end users.
So with the 3D UNIV+RSES, our ambition is really to virtualize the entire life cycle of all those end products. So it's really how to
make it possible for the customers to get the virtual twin of everything for everyone.
Virtualizing the cycle of life is possible by connecting the virtual on one hand and the real on the other hand, but also connecting
the virtual twin together. And I was mentioning this, for instance, for a car, we can connect the virtual twins of its design, of its
engineering, of its manufacturing, but also of its usage.
The key point, probably the crucial factor, is all the 3D UNIV+RSES we are creating make the generativity trustable. And this concept
of trust is extremely important because if, at the end, all the products needs to be certified to comply with regulations. And we are
capable to do it because we have a science-based space for understanding, experimenting and learning.
Just to give you an example. In the Life Sciences & Healthcare sector, if you look at -- if you combine our multiphysics and multi-
biology modelers, I think we are capable to provide virtual twin, for example, of the heart for specific patients. But more importantly,
if we combine this modeling and simulation with artificial intelligence, the surgeon can now generate the therapeutic scenarios and
validate them. So in a way, those 3D UNIV+RSES are becoming the virtual companion of the surgeons to help them to make better
decisions.
Protecting the patient data is also -- is not only an essential, but also we also have to do the same with the citizens data. And that's
the reason why in the Infrastructure & Cities, I think we have the same concept is how AI powers 3D UNIV+RSES, offer a trusted
environment to manage the complexity, aggregating the corpus of data of citizens, city planning, flows, traffics, consumptions,
demography, I cannot name all of them.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 04, 2025
Copyright © 2025 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9And at the end, we are integrating this into one unified model. Based on this, we can generate automatically the life experiences,
how you manage the traffic, for example, within the city. This [ plasticity ] of the 3D UNIV+RSES is really becoming my view an
operating system for many, many cities.
So what are the consequence of what you have seen? I think this is changing, the positioning of Dassault Systèmes. Now Dassault
Systèmes is becoming the most trusted IP generation and management company for their customers. It's a major strategic movement
for our customers across the 3 sectors we serve. It's almost equivalent what we did in 2012 with 3DEXPERIENCE in terms of
impacts.
So to summarize, 3D UNIV+RSES embed multiple generative AI technology at the core of our 3DEXPERIENCE platform, and this is
the reason why it's a Generation 7. It's not a version 7. It's a way to enrich our platforms. Whatever is the 3DEXPERIENCE platform,
the MEDIDATA platform, the Centric PLM platform.
Our multi-AI platform provides customers with a world-class secure environment to reveal and generate their own knowledge and
know-how. And with AI, we are clearly empowering all the organizations, consumer, patient and citizens with knowledge and know-
how.
With this, I think we are expanding our offering in addition to our industry process and role and solutions by introducing new
categories of experience as a service, the generative experience, the virtual companions and the virtual twin experience as a services.
And finally, keep this in mind, it's about trust. 3D UNIV+RSES make the generativity reliable, and we are really committed to
protecting our customers' intellectual property.
So thanks to our 40 years industrial legacy and the immense customer base we have, we are training our artificial intelligence engines
on the most meaningful corpuses to create the highest value for our customers. And these key points will be really -- we will discuss it
on a regular basis. Quarter-after-quarter, we will come to you with proof point of what we are saying. And definitely, this will be the
focal point of discussion for the upcoming Capital Market Day in June this year.
So in the meantime, I think it's time for me to hand over to Rouven to give more detail about the performance for the quarter and for
the full year. Rouven, you have the floor.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Thank you, Pascal. Good morning to all of you here in Paris and listening on this webcast. As you heard, this quarter, and I think I
have to be mindful here, yes, we are now transitioning to the financial highlights and objectives later on.
So as you heard, this quarter was a strong proof point. It was a strong proof point of our resilience and competitiveness, and it
translated to 9% growth in software revenue and also a solid margin expansion of 70 basis points.
Clearly, and I think you can clearly take this away from Pascal's presentation, it demonstrates the trusted customer and partner
relationships that we have built over decades, and many of them have expanded their commitments with us in 2024.
For the full year, I would like to highlight the operational strength of our business. Thanks to the productivity gains and the effective
resource allocation, we achieved a healthy EPS growth of 9% and also improved our cash conversion in a quite volatile market
environment.
Now let's take a deeper look into the financial performance for the quarter and the full year. In Q4, total revenue grew 7%, was driven
by strong growth in new business, up 13%. Operating margin improved 70 basis points to 36.3%, and we delivered EPS at EUR 0.40,
up 11% year-over-year. For the full year, total revenue was up 5%, with software revenue growing 6% and subscription revenue
growth up 10%. Our subscription revenue growth trends continue to be strong.
When excluding MEDIDATA, the growth is 20% for the year. This is driving up the share of recurring revenue to now 80% of our
software revenue. Operating margin was 31.9%, and EPS was EUR 1.28, and it was up 9% year-over-year, driven by the productivity
improvements. At the same time, we remain focused on innovation. It is how we differentiate and win against competition across all
the sectors.
Now with this, let's take a look at our growth drivers. 2024 has been a year of competitive success. It was driven by the expansion
of 3DEXPERIENCE across industries, domains and geographies. In Q4, 40% of the 3DEXPERIENCE deals were competitive
displacements.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 04, 2025
Copyright © 2025 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10Industry leaders are adopting 3DEXPERIENCE as a knowledge platform across the entire enterprise and the value network. And this
is reflected in the strong 3DEXPERIENCE growth with software revenue of EUR 376 million, up an impressive 22%. In the quarter,
large transactions with a value of greater than EUR 5 million contributed more than 90% to this growth.
While cloud revenue for the group grew 7% in 2024, mainly due to the lower contribution of MEDIDATA. The cloud revenue
excluding MEDIDATA was up 41% in the year, with 3DEXPERIENCE cloud up over 50%. The cloud represents 24% of our full
year software revenue.
Now let's review briefly how we performed relative to our objectives for Q4. Total revenue came in around the midpoint of guidance.
Performance was driven by strong software revenue growth. Operating margin was 36.3%. It was 20 basis points below the midpoint
of guidance, and EPS was at EUR 0.40. It was above the midpoint, thanks to the resilience of our business model as expenses were
largely in line with revenue growth.
Now let's turn to the geographies and product lines. First to the geos. Europe showed strong acceleration in Q4, up 14% and 6% for
the full year. It was led by France and Southern Europe, thanks to the large deals we closed in Aerospace & Defense as well as in
Home & Lifestyle.
Also you saw this morning in our press release, and Pascal just talked about it, we signed a strategic agreement with Volkswagen
Group, which is expanding our footprint significantly across the group and into manufacturing. And it's going to ramp up over several
years.
In the Americas, revenue was up 5% in the quarter and 4% in the full year. Competitive displacements are driving our momentum,
most notably in Aerospace & Defense. Lockheed Martin, as you heard, entered an agreement to expand their 3DEXPERIENCE
footprint across new programs and also into manufacturing.
Asia was good in the quarter, up 7% and was led by healthy double-digit growth in Japan and India, while China was rather soft in the
quarter part -- in part due to the high baseline effect compared to last year. For the full year, Asia demonstrated resilient growth with
software revenue of 9%, which was led by Japan, India as well as good performance in Southeast Asia.
Now let's switch to our product line performance. Industrial Innovation software revenue grew 8% in Q4, driven by strong momentum
with 3DEXPERIENCE wins. Our industrial customers are looking for best practices to redefine engineering and manufacturing,
connecting virtual and real worlds. This is what's driving the exceptional growth in manufacturing, which DELMIA was up over 30%
in the quarter.
In Life Sciences, we saw the expected improvement for MEDIDATA, returning to growth, up 1% in Q4. As Pascal outlined, 2024
was a year of transformation to reposition MEDIDATA in our Life Science's strategy. The strategy is endorsed by our clients. In the
fourth quarter, we signed key long-term renewals with tops -- with several top 10 pharma customers, including several win-backs
and platform expansions with our most strategic accounts. And most notably, as you heard, with Eli Lilly, we expanded our top 10
footprint, signing a strategic enterprise agreement, including Rave, for the first time.
All of the above resulted in healthy bookings growth versus last year, driven by large pharma and mid-market, highlighting our
competitive strength. On the flip side, we still see a degree of caution in terms of bookings cost from CRO partners. The business
dynamic for large pharma and mid-market is driven by the cycle of innovation and transformation, while CROs is much more
dependent on volumes of steady starts.
In total, for MEDIDATA, we won also over more than 200 net new customers in 2024. And we expanded our market share by over 1
point in clinical trials driven by large share gains in Phase III and Phase II.
Now to Mainstream Innovation. Clearly, a success story. We continued the strong momentum we saw throughout 2024. What stands
out this quarter is the growth acceleration of SOLIDWORKS. We delivered high single-digit growth, while Centric continued the
outstanding performance throughout 2024 and delivered a strong finish in Q4, driven by an exceptional number of renewals.
Notably, deals for Centric in the quarter included LVMH, Leclerc, H&M and ShopSense. And you see here how we are building the
momentum on Centric. It's coring very consistently, and the deal sizes are expanding quarter-over-quarter.
And to fulfill our growth in the years to come, we are expanding into new verticals and within the consumer-centric industries as well
as position PLM as an end-to-end business platform to operate consumer-centric businesses.
Now let's turn to our cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash and cash equivalents totaled EUR 3.953 billion at the end of 2024, and it
compares to EUR 3.568 billion at the end of 2023. It's an increase of EUR 384 million.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 04, 2025

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11At the end of Q4 2024, our net cash position totaled EUR 1.459 billion, an increase of EUR 881 million versus the net cash position of
EUR 578 million at the end of last year. It's up over 2.5x.
Now let's look at what's driving our cash position at the end of the quarter. We generated EUR 1.660 billion in operating cash flow
for the full year. It's an increase of 6% versus last year. It was driven by higher net income, while year-over-year changes in working
capital were flat.
Higher increases in trade AR reflects strong business activity in Q4 and was partially offset by an increase in contract liabilities.
Nonoperating working capital was favorable, mainly thanks to our lower tax payments. And for further details, please refer to our
reconciliation, which we published this morning. Thanks to the improved working capital, cash conversion from non-IFRS operating
income was up 3 points to 84%.
To conclude, operating cash flow this year was used for cash dividends paid in Q2 of EUR 303 million, the net purchase of treasury
shares totaling EUR 374 million, CapEx investments of EUR 189 million related to new offices in France, U.S. and India as well as IT
equipment and software, repayment of lease liabilities of EUR 80 million and EUR 501 million of repayment of debt, net of proceeds.
Now let's turn to our fiscal year outlook for 2025. As you saw this -- in this morning's press release, we expect our full year 2025 total
revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8% with software revenue growth at 6% to 8%. Subscription growth is expected to be in the
range of 13% to 15%, driving new business growth up in the range of 9% to 12%. We expect the share of recurring revenue to reach
81% of software revenue in 2025, and service revenue growth is expected at 3% to 6%.
In terms of profitability, we anticipate the full year 2025 operating margin in the range of 32.6% to 32.9%, a year-over-year expansion
of 70 to 100 basis points, ex FX and EPS up 7% to 10% growth. This reflects strong operating leverage, thanks to productivity gains
we achieved in 2024 that will now come into effect.
We ended 2024 on a strong note, demonstrating great resilience in a year that presented new challenges and opportunities. Let me
share the key assumptions to the 7% total revenue growth. First, we expect the momentum of 3DEXPERIENCE adoption to continue
to drive growth in Industrial Innovation across key industries such as aerospace, defense, industrial equipment and high tech.
The auto sector continues to play a crucial role. However, we reflected some degree of caution by reducing the contribution of this
sector, specifically as it relates to larger deals. The potential of 3DEXPERIENCE in 2025 is to expand our footprint further into
manufacturing and the value network.
In Mainstream Innovation, we see an increasing confidence by our partners to drive the growth in SOLIDWORKS with new users and
platform expansions.
Centric PLM had an exceptional year, driven by large renewal cycles in 2024. And now in 2025, we expect the growth to be aligned
with our midterm plan of mid- to high teens.
In Life Sciences, we expect mid-single-digit growth for MEDIDATA. This considers continued momentum with large pharma and
mid-market clients, while we anticipate CROs will continue to face volume pressure in study starts, similar to 2024.
It is important to highlight that our confidence with large pharma is driven by the adoption of our newly launched products. With
clinical data studio, we are revolutionizing data management, applying AI to reduce time lines, risk and ensure safety.
As it relates to early and late-phase markets, we are now very well positioned with Rave Light to capture incremental growth in
dynamic -- in this dynamic market. It represents a key pillar to our growth strategy in 2025 and beyond.
Now let's turn to Q1, and let me provide you some insights which will help you to model the starting point. We see a more balanced
year between H1 and H2 as compared to 2024. In Q1, we anticipate total and software revenue growth in the range of 3% to 8%,
reflecting a degree of caution as it relates to timing of deal signatures in the current context. To complete the picture, subscription
revenue growth is anticipated in the range of 8% to 14% and upfront license revenue in the range of 0% to 9% growth.
In terms of profitability, we expect the operating margin to be in the range of 31% to 31.1% and fully diluted EPS in the range of EUR
0.30 to EUR 0.32 or up 3% to 7% year-over-year growth ex FX.
Now let me conclude. 2024 confirmed the strong customer relationships, evidenced by a number of large breakthrough competitive
wins in our core sectors. This reflects the confidence from our clients ready to engage in the long term.
We prepared 2025 with the right investments to open a new era and to expand our customer relationships with 3DEXPERIENCE,
while delivering our EPS target in 2025, thanks to productivity gains.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 04, 2025

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 13Question and Answer
Antonin Baudry
HSBC, Research Division
Yes. Anton from HSBC. Congratulation on my side for the Volkswagen contracts and other contracts signed in Q1. My first question
is about these contracts. Will it possible to have more details about how you win this contract with Volkswagen?
It's a transforming contract. You said 40,000 seats. It seems to be a bit more than Jaguar Land Rover. Which kind of revenues should
we expect on this contract? And when should we expect this contract to be accounted in the revenues of the group?
I have a second question related to the 2025 guidance. The revenue growth guidance remains below 10%, let's say, below your 2028
targets, but your operating margin expectations appear above the 50 basis points that you expected. How should we see the 2028 target
in the frame of this 2025 guidance?
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Rouven, I can start with the context and then for Volkswagen, and you will give probably more detail on the financial impact.
So it was 2-year decision process. So it was a long, long, long process. And the reason was because at the beginning, they splitted the
different parts. They issued an RFP for the engineering part and issued an RFP for the manufacturing part. And I was, I think, the one
who argued that if they want to get the benefit of what we do, they should at least combine the 2 and to select 1 solution for both.
They were not prepared for this because it was extremely difficult to get the consensus within the company, not only to harmonize the
different PLM systems on the engineering side but, more importantly, to harmonize the PLM on the manufacturing side.
As you could imagine, you have all the competitors involved in these deals. And when I'm telling you it's once almost every 20 years,
it's the reality. The last time we signed a big contract with them was 20 years ago when they selected CATIA.
So we battled like hell. But at the end, the surprising part for them was how advanced we are on the manufacturing side. They had no
doubt about our ability to basically design the new software-defined vehicles because we have a significant footprint with all the new
players. But they were really questioning our competitiveness on the manufacturing side for the auto sector. And I think this is really
the proof point of the maturity of our solutions on this front.
And how if you combine the 2, that's the only way to reduce the cycle time by 2. That's the only way. There is no other way to make it
happen. And given all the challenges they have, as you can imagine, it was not an easy decision.
The last comment I can make, we were significantly more expensive than most of the competitors. And when the company is in a
tough time, which is the case for Volkswagen, building the case and going to the Board to get the approval for such an investment,
you have to be pretty sure about the value of what you are delivering ultimately.
And I think this is also a sign for you about the readiness of our solutions. It's not only some case-to-case we have with certain OEMs.
At least, now we have at a point whereby we have the ability to demonstrate relatively easily the benefits of our solutions.
And if you combine all those things, we have been able to win. And as I was saying, it's a very important thing, not only in terms of
number of users, in terms of footprint, but we built the -- and we structured the contract in a way that this -- we still have ability to
continue to expand on top of it, right?
Do not conclude that with this contract, we have basically set up the footprint and we -- basically, we capture all the potential growth
with them for the next 5 to 10 years. We still have a significant lever on top of what we signed.
So maybe, Rouven, you can give some additional comments on the financial impacts.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Sure.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 14CEO & Director
Knowing that I do not want you to share everything because...
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
No, no. I'm wondering what I can say in the...
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
No. But there is a lot of competitive insight. And I do not want to share with the rest of the folks.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes, for sure. So what I can share is the impact to Q4 is very marginal. The -- it's a full subscription contract that we are signing. It's
cloud-based. And we are going to -- it's a contract right now, which is, as I said, it's recurring. It's over multiple years. It's 7 years. It
also has an extension to another 10 years.
So it's a really long-term contract, and it has the potential to double. So it's going to double already committed with this contract
within the first 4 years because we have an existing contract with Volkswagen, but it's going to double again within 4 years based on
the run rate that we are establishing now in the new contract. And after that, it will continue to grow.
So it will probably double 2x, but it's recurring, that's important. And it creates, as Pascal said, a lot of opportunity to do value up and
expand further on top. So it leaves us a lot of options, while it's a strong commitment at the same time to double the revenue run rate
that was existing in the next 4 years with a run -- with the path to further increase.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Maybe I should add 1 comment, which is you remember that Germany was really the only place where we didn't have deployed
massively the 3DEXPERIENCE platform. And this was having an impact on the supply chain because their supply chain was
managing different systems.
Having the same year of the BMW under 3DEXPERIENCE platform in context with Volkswagen, now I think this is also a
significant lever on the supply chain. This will accelerate the penetration of the auto supply chain, especially at a time where, also,
they are under pressure. So keep this in mind, it's an additional lever we have on top of this.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes, it's on top.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
The second question?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
The second question is regarding the guidance and your question around being below 10%. We are forecasting in 2025 an acceleration
to 6% to 8%. We are looking at a strong margin improvement.
So I like the way you phrase this. We are clearly expanding on the margin side, but we are building at the same point in time the
foundation to reach the high single to double-digit growth in 2026, while we continue to expand our margins.
So we are in a way, as it relates to this in a year of growth acceleration and transition, to that level of high single to double-digit
growth that we would -- that we are going to expect in the future.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15CEO & Director
Yes, Laurent?
Laurent Daure
Kepler Cheuvreux, Research Division
It's Laurent of Kepler Cheuvreux. Three quick question for me. First one is same as Anton, but on Lockheed Martin. I'm sure you were
expecting this one.
The second one is on MEDIDATA. I know you had a lot of deals to renew in the fourth quarter. Question is, have you managed to
renew all of them? And I think the plan from your Head of Sales was to renew at nearly 5% or 10% price increases. Have you been
able to achieve that?
And the last question is more open. On NVIDIA, you announced them as a partner. I think it was in the second quarter last year.
And then they came with some talks at a recent conference talking about the virtual twin with Accenture. Do you still see them as a
partner? Or can they become a competitor in the long term?
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
I can give some context again for Lockheed Martin Group because as I was stating, it is only -- it's not only for the aircraft, it's for the
space and basically everything they do. You remember, it's almost the same story than the Volkswagen. We had a significant presence
on the engineering side, but the manufacturing was basically a large Siemens base.
So I would say it's almost the same basically consequences or the same implication of what you just say for Lockheed Martin. I think
with this, we are doubling the size of the revenue we do with Lockheed Martin. And we probably have again an ability to double
again.
And why this is important? Because you know, the defense and space sector in the U.S. is extremely concentrated. But you also have
a lot of suppliers, and it's still an untapped market for us. So this is also opening the door for us to continue to expand in the supply
chain, having the large OEMs now standardize on 3DEXPERIENCE platform.
The process was almost as complicated as the Volkswagen one, probably with more politics in the game, the same discussion on the
pricing than we had at Volkswagen. But again, we had enough proof points and enough pilots in production to prove that at the end,
the value generating was not the same.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Maybe I can just straight go to the MEDIDATA question. But you're right. It's a subscription contract recurring, and it's doubling of
the commitment and the potential to further grow, as you said, because we are entering into manufacturing, which is a large space.
And the demand is huge, and the supply is what is currently limited. And so the investment into the manufacturing capacity and
efficiency is what's key to them. And the relationship with the company is very strong.
And again, we were selected based on value, I just echoed what Pascal was saying, and not based on the price, which was also went up
to the CFO of Lockheed Martin that we interacted with. So it's a very good relationship.
So we are very pleased with the outcome of this transaction and the visibility it creates for this industry for us in the U.S. and for us
in the future. And if you now it -- we understand it. It was something we've been talking about for some time and wanted to close
certainly earlier in 2024, but we did it in Q4 at the right terms.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16MEDIDATA, you have a good memory, Laurent. We had a lot of renewals in Q4, and we signed them all. We also were successful in
terms of the growth that comes along with the renewals, not necessarily only from price increase, but from value and new innovation
and expansion with these clients.
And of course, many of those renewals were competitive, but we didn't lose one share. And this gives us also the confidence on the
large and the top pharma and mid-market that our strategy is very well endorsed by our clients. And it gives us the visibility and
backlog strength for the years to come because these are long-term renewals. So that's factored into our outlook.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
NVIDIA, you're right. They are a long-standing partner. Because if you remember, for the one who are following us for a long
time, what they were doing, they were developing the graphic cards, and the CAD system was probably one of the most demanding
software on the graphics. So we know them extremely well.
Now when I'm making those statements about at the end, the Gen 7 is about Dassault Systèmes becoming the champion of artificial
intelligence for the industrial sector, it means something. It means that for the industrial sector, there are certain things. We are
probably the only one able to do. To have a trustable generative artificial intelligence is one thing because, remember, all the things,
whenever, it's a drug, a plane, a car, a bottle of shampoo, you need to comply with regulations, and you need to prove. And to prove,
you have to make the demonstrations. It cannot be a black box.
And most of the AI engine right now are working like a black box. How NVIDIA is doing things? They are using the visualizations
and they try to learn from the visualizations. There is no scientific foundation in what they do. Us in the platform, you have all the
domain expertise from all the physics and all the biology, all the control, almost all the disciplines, the scientific disciplines, which are
extremely helpful if you want to basically again prove and demonstrate.
The second thing is the IP protection for our customer is extremely sensitive. And right now, they put a lot of value on people coming
with solutions preserving their intellectual property. The idea is obviously the AI systems needs to be trained and to learn.
But at the end, they want to ensure that it stays with their own intellectual property. It is not a way for others to get access to what they
have developed for the last 40 years. And I think we have developed the proper mechanisms in order to ensure this.
And last but not least, I think, for me, NVIDIA is an infrastructure. It's like the basic platform in order to have the capacity to do
certain computations in a way to accelerate the learnings. At the end, what we are talking about is the knowledge and the know-how.
So you need to have a system to understand what the knowledge and know-how is about. I think this is what Dassault Systèmes is
doing for the last 40 years. So in a way, to come back to your questions, yes, there is -- I mean, they have this omniverse concept,
which is definitively in competition with the 3D UNIV+RSES.
But I think we are much more well equipped, for all the reasons I gave to you, to protect our customers' base, to leverage the
large corpus of data -- virtual data they are creating over the last 40 years and, more importantly, to make it with a solid scientific
foundation, which is pretty unique on the market.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
More questions in the room? Yes, Derric.
Derric Marcon
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
Derric Marcon from Bernstein. If we continue on the AI topic, what would be your pricing strategy? Or how do you plan to monetize
this investment? Is it by product or increasing the price of existing offers? That's my first question.
And the second question is about the large deals that have been taken into account in the 2025 guidance. Can you share with us some
hypothesis that you take here and especially compared to what you did at the beginning of 2024 last year?
Pascal Daloz
CEO & DirectorDASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 04, 2025
Copyright © 2025 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 17Well, I will take the first one and you take the second one. I will not give you all the details because, again, we spend a lot of time to
think about it. But nevertheless, I can summarize it easily for you.
The entire pricing system is based on the name user right now, right? You need to be declared into the systems with your name in
order to get access to the capabilities we are providing, and it's packaged in a role. So that's what we are pricing.
With all the AI capability, obviously, we are displacing it because you have virtual companions. So they are, in a way, some virtual
users, and I'm pricing them. And I'm pricing them not on the same basis because I'm pricing them on the ability for them to generate
intellectual property.
So this is our way to at least structure the value we bring and put a price on it. But we will come back on this on the Capital Market
Day because this will be probably one of the key discussions.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Yes. And on the competitive strength of MEDIDATA, that was your second one, right?
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
On the large deals.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
On the large deals. The hypothesis of in terms of large deals, how they contribute, yes, I thought you were asking also about the
competitiveness about -- in this. But it's fair enough.
So the good news is that most of those large deals have been signed and renewed. We had a large renewal year in 2024. So these
revenue streams are not committed over the next years, and they will add to our growth in -- starting to add to our growth in 2025.
They give us visibility into the next years. They are factored into our guidance. And there, if you look at the mid-market and the large
top pharma together are growing above what we guide to because we have to absorb the lower gross contribution from the CROs.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Talking about general...
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
General, okay. So I don't why I assumed MEDIDATA. Generally speaking, well, in the guidance, the large deals, they are -- my
introduction works here also very well. They are all signed behind us. They are subscription recurring, so they continue to support us
in '25, but also in the years to come.
They are reflected in our subscription line in 2025. And if you look at our industrial innovation part, because this is where those large
deals sit, they're taking quite a large share. There -- those large deals that we signed over the last 2 years are more than 20% already of
our subscription baseline in Industrial Innovation.
So they have a strong impact in terms of giving us visibility and growth for years to come. And so they're helping us to project and
have visibility in our subscription guidance, which is a midpoint of 14%.
And of course, we have other -- we have more large deals in our pipeline in 2025. They will also contribute. The contracting model for
this, in most of the cases, is a subscription model. So we'll continue to build our run rate on top of that.
And as we said before, the deals we signed, they have further potential to be expanded with the enterprise and with the value network.
So there is expansion opportunities and in a way of a clear road map, right, to connect these dots and add to growth.
So do you want to go to the webcast?

Mohammed Essaji Moawalla
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
And congrats on a results and the contract wins. Two from me, if I may. Firstly, we look at the sort of subscription revenue growth ex
MEDIDATA for Life Sciences. It has been quite volatile for the quarter. And when we look at the guidance -- implied guidance for
the year [indiscernible] acceleration, particularly in the back end of the year in the high 20s.
Can you just help us understand the visibility you have around achieving that, whether that's from backlog or the ramp-ups and kind of
how you provisioned against some of the end market dynamics?
And then secondly, obviously, with Lockheed and BMW getting over the line, can you remind us again what kind of the pipeline that
you have on some of these larger transactions across the different, auto, aero, industrial end markets?
And to what extent these will become a catalyst in driving some of those conversions? Because I know this was a big challenge you
had 2024. And to what extent this is reflected -- some of the larger opportunities are reflective into your kind of outlook?
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Thank you, Mo. I take the first question.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
You can also take maybe this one.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
And also the second one. Fair enough. Subscription growth ex MEDIDATA in 2024 was 20%, while the total subscription grew at
10%. The levers for growth acceleration and visibility more for 2025, we -- given the success of large deals and converting them to
recurring subscriptions, when we look at our baseline starting into 2025, of everything that we have contracted and what we have in
front of us to renew, we have well over 80% of our target of 14% growth already covered within our existing contract base for 2025.
So our backlog is strong. Our coverage is good. The remaining part, which is required for growth is well covered by our pipeline of
deals that we have in 2025. So with this, we have good level of visibility to this 14% growth in subscription.
And then to the second question regarding the pipeline of large deals, I would categorize it like this that it's well diversified. It is
clearly in the aero and space sector, also in the defense sector, industrial equipment.
We have been prudent more on the auto sector, but we have, of course, opportunities and also larger opportunities in the auto sector in
2025. And we see that the announcement we've made over 2024 are catalysts for decisions of other players in this industry.
So we are optimistic about it. And I also believe in high tech, we have -- and marine and offshore. We have a good set of opportunities
that are stronger than in 2024.

Our next question comes from Adam Wood of Morgan Stanley.
Adam Dennis Wood
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
I also have 2. Maybe just, first of all, on Bayer. I think the big competitor there have won a fair share of the new trial business of that
company. Could you just give us a little bit more insight into that win of Bayer? Is that for the existing trials that you continue to run?
Or is this some proportion of the new trials that are coming back to you as a result of that deal?
And then maybe just coming back to the GenAI and maybe moving away from NVIDIA and thinking about the traditional
competitors. I guess, the issue here is the model has been probabilistic and you may even be geometrically exact. But obviously, they
enabled you to automate a lot of things in terms of being able to train models on real-world data rather than having to code every
scenario.DASSAULT SYSTÈMES SE FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 04, 2025

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 19So is the air here to train the models on scientifically based data that your customers have generated and, therefore, you can start to
automate a lot more things? Is that kind of the general idea? Could you just talk a little bit about the time frame for that to happen
and then maybe how you see the competitors positioned against you in this area and how it could impact your M&A strategy if you
believe you could automate a lot more quickly with this techniques rather than potentially buying some of the players that have more
traditional techniques to develop a code?
Pascal Daloz

Take the first one, and I think there's one more.
Rouven Bergmann

On Bayer, yes, it's incremental. It's expanding on trials, but it's mostly expanding in early and late phase. We always had a strong
footprint in Phase II and Phase III already. We also are expanding in Patient Cloud. And these are the main drivers of the expansion
with Bayer.
Bayer is a client. We said it's a long-term customer. But in the recent years, we had some challenges around their renewals. What we
see here is another example where we're doing the right thing and the customers coming back. We have the win back here, and it's
validating our strategy that we are winning with value and not with price.

The second part of your question, Adam, is -- at least it's very simple. We already have the platform in place in many of the large
accounts. All the data sets are in it. We are progressively introducing all the AI technology as part of the platform. And we already
started, by the way, to develop some experiences.
You remember a few years ago, we came with the generative design, which was a way to have the design being driven by -- it is a
simulation engine in conjunction with artificial intelligence.
So why I'm saying this? It's because the train has been launched, and you will see quarter after quarter, we are coming with extensive
new generative experiences or new virtual companions. And we will come -- we will have basically the speed in our advantages
because if you -- for many of our competitors or the people who are willing to follow the same pattern, they need to first to put in
place the data lake.
And we know that transferring the data to one system to another one, it's a nightmare for simple reason is because none of them
understand the configuration. And you have to understand that what you have into the platform, it's configured.
So which basically means it's not only a transfer of the basic data. You need to also to understand what we call the metadata. And
you have more metadata into the systems and you have the data by itself. It's something the system knows by design. So we are not
spending time to do IT for the purpose to deliver the value.
So right now, I don't know, we have almost 100 customer engagements with artificial intelligence on many, many different sectors.
Obviously, some on the auto sector, but also in the shipbuilding, as you say, architecture and construction, which is really suitable for
the generative approach.
But more recently, we're also expanding in the food industry with the generative food design. Because as you may know, in the food
industry, you have a lot of constraints and you have to replace many, many ingredients in the future. And this domain, which was
really operational driven, is becoming more and more scientific.
So if I do the sum of this, I think we are on track and well prepared and, clearly, well engaged with many of our large customers. And
again, they are trusting us, which if there is one thing you should keep in mind in this game, they will partner with the people they
trust.
And we have built this trust for the last 40 years by managing their intellectual property. And that's the reason why I think we are in a
very good position to, I think I'm repeating myself, but to become the champion of the industrial artificial intelligence.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 20Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, we have time for only one question. Our last question for today is coming from Mr.
Frederic Boulan of Bank of America.
Frederic Emile Alfred Boulan
BofA Securities, Research Division
If you can discuss a bit your free cash flow outlook for '25 and beyond. If you can talk about some of the main moving parts in terms
of conversion. Working cap was, I think, EUR 20 million negative in '24. Any insights on what that could trend considering deal
phasing, et cetera?
Tax rate is very low. In the guidance for '25, that will remain low, I guess, 15.5% when you talked about the next few years on this
and also from a cash perspective. So anything you can share with us in terms of how free cash flow will move versus, I guess, EBIT
will be very useful.
Rouven Bergmann
CFO & Executive VP
Okay. Thank you, Frederic. Just one question, thank you. We are looking at our operating cash flow next year to grow in line with our
business growth. We are expecting it -- the growth to be around 8% in operating cash flow. We also are expecting operating profits to
grow around 8%.
We expect improvements in working capital, as you pointed out in 2025, simply because some of the large contracts that had some
more challenging conversion structure at the beginning of this contract, we are now at a point where we are seeing the reverse effect.
And we will be able to see the benefit of these contracts and higher cash payments in 2025 and 2026 from this. So this, we will benefit
from.
On the tax side, of course, it's a volatile environment. It's hard to predict at this point because there is discussion in France about
exceptional taxes in 2025. That could be on top. We have estimated it. It's -- for now in our estimation, we -- maybe the risk is around
EUR 20 million to EUR 25 million for us in 2025 of additional tax expense. But given it's exceptional, it won't impact our non-IFRS
results. It will be -- but it will have an impact on the cash flow.
So that will have to be factored in once we have more clarity. But again, I am -- and I see the conversion, which was 84% in 2024 to
be consistent also in 2025. And when I say conversion is operating cash flow converting from non-IFRS operating income.
Pascal Daloz
CEO & Director
Thank you. So this is concluding our session. Again, thank you very much for your participation, the ones who are here with us and
for the ones being connected.
We expect to you in person in the coming weeks, if we can, most of you. And as far as I'm concerned, I'm very excited with our
new horizons. I think, believe me, this is as deep as 3DEXPERIENCE. And if you remember, when we came in 2012, February 9,
at least some of you were scratching their head -- your head, telling all those guys they are craze, they come with something I do not
understand.
So probably, the UNIV+RSES concept is still a little bit vague for you. But believe me, we are working the talk, and this is changing
the positioning of Dassault Systèmes for the future, and this is unlocking significant growth for us.
And we will come back on a regular basis for you to not only understand, but to be convinced. And on this, see you no later than next
quarter. Thank you so much.
